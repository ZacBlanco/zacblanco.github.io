I am currently looking for employment after finishing my MSc in Computer Science
at UCSD. Please reach out to me if you or your organization are looking for
low-level, performance, or backend engineers. Previously, I worked as software
engineer at [Alluxio](https://alluxio.io) and earned my undergraduate degree at
[Rutgers University](/education/undergrad/). You can find information about my
most of my research [here](/education/) and the code to my projects
[here](https://github.com/ZacBlanco).
