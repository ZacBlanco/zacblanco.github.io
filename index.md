I am currently a [PhD student](/education/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu)
working with Prof. Yiying Zhang in [WukLab](https://wuklab.io). Previously, I
worked as software engineer at [Alluxio Inc.](https://alluxio.io) and earned my
undergraduate degree at [Rutgers University](/education/undergrad/). You can
find my most of my research and projects on my
[github](https://github.com/ZacBlanco). There are notes for the classes that I
took during my undergrad [here](/education/undergrad/)
