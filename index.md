Hi, my name is Zac (if you didn't figure that out already). I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University through the spring of 2018.

I like writing [code](https://github.com/zacblanco) and doing research.

You can find notes for some of the classes that I took [here](education/)
