##  Intro

- Community wireless networks share a few wires connections amongst a
  large group of users
    - two approaches
        - carefully construct multi-hop network with nodes in special
          locations
        - hot-spot loosely connected nodes
    - ambitious -- combine best of both network types
        - little central planning, but still have wide coverage
- evaluation of:
    - unconstrained node placement
    - omni-directional antennas
    - multi-hop routing
    - optimization of routing for throughput in slowly changing network
- RoofNet analysis (37 nodes in a city)


## RoofNet Design

- deployed over 4 sq km (cambridge, MA)
- antenna locations not random, but not planned either
- Each node is a PC, 802.11b card and roof-mounted omni-directional
  antenna.
- 8dBi omni-antenna. 3dB vertical beam @ 20 deg.
- slightly modified pseudo-IBSS mode to prevent network partitioning
- each node essentially acts as the router when a device plugs into it
- software needs to automatically solve a number of problems:
    - addressing
        - roofnet sends ip packets inside its own header format and
          routing protocol
        - nodes must be able to assign address automatically without
          explicit configuration, use part of ethernet address and
          class-A IP block
        - use NAT
    - Gateways and internet access
        - each node attempts to configure itself as a gateway, first and
          marks itself so if possible
        - gateway itself acts as NAT for connection from RoofNet to the internet
            - (2-layer NAT)
        - if a new gateway is chosen during a TCP connection, the TCP
          connection may fail
- Routing protocol
    - named srcr - find highest throughput route between any pair of
      roofnet nodes
    - use dijkstra's to find routes, maintains metrics on links
    - if no route found, send a flood packet to gather route information
    - flood queries often don't follow the best route
- routing metric
    - uses a metric called "ETT" - estimated transmission time
    - predict total time to send data packet along a particular route
    - predicts highest throughput bit rate is the bit rate with highest
      product of delivery probability and bit-rate
    - ETT for a given link is the expected time to send a 1500-byte packet
      at a link's highest throughput bit-rate
- bit-rate selection
    - transmit rates of 1, 2, 5.5, 11mbit/s
    - avoids bit rates with high loss
    - sampleRate algorithm adjusts the bit-rate as it sends data packets
      over a link

## Evaluation

- performance
    - mediam throughput is 400kbit/s, mean is 627
    - distribution of speeds generally correlated with hop count
    - rootnet one-hop routes operate at average speed consistent with
      5.5mbit transmission rate.
    - long routes suffer from inter-hop collisions
    - still reasonable speeds (4 hops at 379kbit/s)

- link quality+distance
    - most links only capable of ~500kbit/s at best from 500-1300m
    - shorter distances seems to increase link speed
    - fast short hops best policy
- density effects
    - network approaches all pairs connected at ~20 pairs
- mesh robustness
     - only a few poorly connected nodes
     - performance likely drops if links get eliminated
     - best links have high impact on network throughput

- architectural alternatives
    - 5 gateways requires to connect all roofnet nodes
    - multi-hop forwarding provides higher average throughput
    - for single-hop network, 25 gateways would be requires. 90% with 10
      gateways
    - for 5 or fewer gateways, random gateway assignment is better even
      than single-hop
    - for more than 5, careful gateway assignment can increase throughput
