## Lecture 1 - January 19th 2016

- See the [notes for lecture 1 here](../Review-of-basics-of-EEI.pdf)
- [Homework 1 (Due Jan 26th)](../HW-due-Jan-26.pdf)


We introduce a new notation we'll call the "Laplace Domain". It is similar to the phasor domain from PEE 1. It's very simple.

We introduce the variable $$s$$.

> $$ s = j\omega $$

We solve everything the same way as we previously did. But now we just replace every $$j\omega$$ with $$s$$.

It's that simple!

## Lecture 2

**Basic Introduction to Fourier Transforms of a Time Domain Signal**

- Fourier and Laplace revolutionized many fields by introducing the concept that **any signal can be thought of as being composed by a number (finite or infinite) of sinusoidal signal of different frequencies, amplitudes, and phase angles**.

That is the sinusoidal signals that compose a signal $$x(t)$$ are called the **frequency components** of $$x(t)$$. If a sinal has a countably finite or infinite number of frequency components, then

> $$ x(t) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^N X_kcos(\omega_kt + \theta_k) $$
