We introduce a new notation we'll call the "Laplace Domain". It is similar to the phasor domain from PEE 1. It's very simple.

We introduce the variable $$s$$.

> $$ s = j\omega $$

We solve everything the same way as we previously did. But now we just replace every $$j\omega$$ with $$s$$.

It's that simple!
