## Defining Social Psychology

**Social Psychology** is the scientific study of how individuals think, feel, and behave in a social context.

#### How does social psychology differ from other ideas and fields?

- Common Sense
  - "Knew it all along" phenomena
  - Determining fact from myth
  - Social Psychology relies on the scientific method
  - Forming hypotheses -- testable predictions
  - Organizing ideas and findings into 
- History/Philosophy
- Sociology
  - Focus is on the person, rather than the group
- Other Types of Psychology (Abnormal, Cognitive, etc..)

- Social Psychology relies on the scientific method

**Proximal Influences**: immediate and/or situational influences.

**Distal Influences**: Not immediately affecting behavior. Ex. Cultural background

**Overjustification Effect**: Adding a reward to an enjoyable task will cause the person to be unhappy when performing the task without the reward.

## Research Methods 

There are 4 stages of social psychological research.

1. Develop an Idea
2. Refine the Idea
3. Test the Idea
4. Interpret the Results

For number 1. we want to: 

- Ask questions
- Search through literature
- Shape the idea into a hypothesis

**Hypothesis**: A testable prediction

**Theory**: An organized set of principles used to define phenomena which is simple, generative, comprehensive, and falsifiable.

**Conceptual Variables vs Operational Definitions**

- A **Conceptual Variable** is some abstract general construct.
- An **Operational Definition** is a measureable definition for a conceptual variable in research.

**Construct Validity**: The extent to which the experiment measures and manipulates variables in the study actually measure or manipulate what they are meant to.

**Interrator Reliability**: The degree to which multiple observers agree in observation

**Correlational Designs**: Examines relationships between multiple variables.

**Experimental Designs**: The cornetstone of psychological research. It is used to examine cause and effect relationships. All experiments have two essential characteristics

- Researchers have control over the experimental procedure
- There should be random assignment to experimental conditions

**Random Sampling Vs Random Assignment**:

- **Random sampling** is when the participants in an experiment are chosen from the population.
- **Random Assignment** is what we call randomly putting participants into different experiemntal groups (control, etc.)

**Statistical Significance**: if the probability of something happening by chance is less than 5% (.05) we usually say a result is statistically significant

**Ethics in Social Psychology**: All studies must adhere to rules.

- We generally don't want to deceive participants
- It must be passed by the IRB
- Participants must have informed consent
- The study must debrief participants

## The Self

**Public self**: How others see us. This is heavily influenced by social factors

**The ABC's of the Self**

- Cognition: Self-Concept - know thyself, self-concept, identity
- Affect: Self-Esteem - The emotional aspects
- Behavior: Self-Presentation - Regulation & Presentation

**Self Concept**: The sum total beliefs that one has about him/herself. It is made up of **Self-schemas**

**Self-Schemas**: How we perceive ourselves and evaluate others. We like to accept information that is in line with our schemas.



**Self-Recognition**:

- Babies don't recognize themselves until 18-24 months old.
- Animals that don't recognize themselves will tend to reach for their reflection.
- Apes will recognize themselves


### Sources of the Self Concept

**1. Introspection**:

- Our inner thoughts and feelings
- Not always accurate, we can impair our own knowledge - overthinking
- Poor predictor of future behavior
- We usually overestimate emotional impact of a situation
  - We usually just focus on something and forget about it
  - Affective forecasting
  
**2. Know ourselves by viewing our own behavior**
  
- **Self-Perception Theory**: Internal cues are difficult to interpret. People gain insight into their own behavior.
- **Facial Feedback Hypothesis**: The changes in facial expressions change emotions

**3. Influences of Others**

- People describe themselves in traits that set themselves apart from others
- **Social Comparison Theory**: We compare our performance to others (when the uncertain about our own).

**4. Autobiographical Memoery**

- Essential for a coherent self-concept.
  - Recall events from our recent past
- Good memories of adolescence are usually the most memorable
- **Flashbulb Memory**: Prominent events that we tend to remember. Not always the most accurate but they _feel special_
- Autobiographical memories are vital, but also shape our identities

**5. Cultural Identity and Influence**

- _Individualism vs Collectivism_
- Individualist: Strive for personal achievement
- Collectivist: Want to advance the group

### **Self Esteem** The _Affective_ Components of the Self

- Belonging = Self Esteem
- **Terror Management Theory**: Terrified by morality
  - Higher self-esteem protects against a fear of death
- Higher self-esteem _tends_ to make people more happy/healthy/productive
  - Not guaranteed success - low social sensitivity usually comes with a high self-esteem

- **Self-Discrepancy Theory**: The self-esteem refelcts matches and mismatches between how we se eourselves and how we want to see ourselves
  - Discrepancy between the _ought-self_ tends to lead to feelings of shame or guilt

**Self Awareness**

- People tend to like to be self-aware - _mirrors_
- Some people are more self-focused than others.
- Private vs Public Self-Conscious
  - Private: Tendency to introspect
  - Public: Tendency to focus on the outer image

**Self-Regulation**: The process by which we seek to control or alter our thoughts, feelings, behaviors and urges

**Ironic Mental Processes**: The harder someone tries to inhibit a thought or behavior the less likely we are to succeed in blocking such thoughts or behaviors

**Implicit Egotism**: Positive traits that are more quickly recognized about ourselves

**Mechanisms of Self-Enhancement**

- **Self-Handicapping**: Excuses for poor behavior - we sabatoge our own performance
- **BIRG**: _Basking In Reflected Glory_ - Assoiate ourselves with success, distance ourselves from our failures.
- **Downward Social Comparison**: We don't always want objective information. We like to compare ourselves to less successful people sometimes.
  - Depressed people tend to have more realistic views

## Perceiving Others


**Social Perception**: The process by which we understand one another.
  - Observation, Attribution, Integration

**Observation**

- Subtley influenced by appearance
- We sometimes pre-judge on facial features
- Baby-facedness: large eyes relative to the size of the head/person
  - Genetically programmed
  - Positive associations with babies
  - Physical appearance
  
  
**Distorted Perceptions**: Sometimes if we expect to see something our brain will actually fill in the gaps.

- We like to infer information form non-verbal behaviors.
- Primary thing we use is facial expressions
- Also: tone of voice
- Gestures
- Body positions/movement
- Use of touch
- Eye Gaze

- It is easiest for us to detect happiness in people using facial expressions

**Attribution Theories**

- Kelley's Covariation Theory: Has 3 components which require multiple observations of a person
  - _Consensus_: How do others react?
  - _Consistency_: Are their actions consistent over time?
  - _Distinctiveness_: Is the reaction the same for different types of stimuli?
  
- Jones's Correspondent inference theory: inferring from actions, a person's personality traits. Whether behavior is:
  - Chosen
  - Expected
  - Person knows effects or consequences

**Attributional Biases**:  Do we analyze behavior rationally or logically?

- **Availability Heuristic**: Tendency to estimate that an event will occur by how available a memory is.
- **False consensus effect**: We overestimate the extent to which others share beliefs and opinions
- **Counterfactual thinking**: The tendency to imagine alternative events or outcomes that might have occurred but did not
- **Fundamental attribution error**: The tendency to focus on the role of personal causes ad underestimate the impact of situations on people's behavior

**Information Integration Theory**: The theory that impressions are based on (1) the perceiver dispositions and (2) a weighted average of a target person's traits

- **Priming**: The tendency for recently used or perceived words or ideas to come to mind easily and influence the interpretation of new information
- and Embodiment
- **Central Traits**: Traits that exert a powerful influence on overall impressions
- **Trait Negativity Bias**: The tendency for negative information to weight more heavily on our impressions than positive information

**Primacy Effect**: The tendency for information presented early in a qsequnce to have more impact on impressions than information presented later.

**Confirmation Bias**: The tendency to seek interpret, and create information that verifies existing beliefs

- **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: The process by which one's expectations about a person eventually lead that person to behave in ways that confirm those expectations
