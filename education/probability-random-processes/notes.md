## Chapter 1 - January 21st 2016

We're going to start first with **Set Theory**

### Set Theory

A **set** is a collection of things. We usually will use capital letters to denote sets

parts of a set are called **elements**. When we use mathematical notation to denote an **element** as being part of a **set** we use the following symbol **\in**

Example: $$ x \in A $$ - x belongs to A

**Set Unions**

The **union** of sets $$A$$ and $$B$$ is the set of all elements that are either in A or in B or in both The union of A and B $$\cup$$

**Set Intersections** 

The **intersection** of sets is set of elements where each elements present in the set of A is also contained in B. We use the symbol $$\cap$$ to show the intersection of two sets.

**Note!**: Typically the $$\cap$$ is not used in problems and the following statements are equivalent:

> $$ P[A\cap B] = P[AB] $$

**Mutually Exclusive** set what we call two sets with no common elements

We call the **universal set** the set which contains everything. That is if we imagine all of our elements being made up of sets $$A_1 \dots A_n $$ then we get $$ A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n = S$$

A **partition** is a set which is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive part of S.

**Theorem 1.1**

De Morgan's law relates all three basic operations

> $$ (A \cup B)^C = A^c \cap B^c $$

<!--Complete later-->

This can be proved by using the following logical steps

1. Suppose x belongs the complement of the union of A and B
  - $$x \in (A \cup B)^c$$
2. Step 1 implies that x does not belong to the union of sets A and B 
  - $$ x \not\in A \cup B $$
3. Step 2 implies that x does not belong to set A nor set B.
  - $$ x \not\in A \text{ and } x \not\in B$$
4. Step 3 implies that x must then belong to the complement of set A and the complement of set B. 
  - $$ x \in A^c \text{ and } x \in B^c$$
5. Step 4 Then must imply that x is contained within the intersection of sets $$A^c$$ and $$B^c$$. 
  - $$ x \in A^c \cap B^c$$

### Applying Set Theory to Probability

An experiment consists of a **procedure** and **observations**. The is uncertainty in what will be observed; otherwise, performing the experiment would be unnecessary

an **outcome** of an experiment is any possible observation of that experiment

The **sample space** of an experiment is the finest-grain, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive set of all possible outcomes.

- Sample space = universal set

an **event** is a **set of outcomes** of an experiment


### Probability Axioms

A **probability measure** P[.] id s function that **maps events in the sample space to real numbers**.

- **Axiom 1** - For any event A, $$P[A] \geq 0$$
- **Axiom 2** - $$P[S] = 1$$
- **Axiom 3** For any countable collection $$A_1, A_2, \dots $$ of mutually exclusive events: $$ P[A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots] = P[A_1] + P[A_2] \dots$$


**Theorem 1.3** 

if $$ A = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_m $$ and $$ A_i \cap A_j = \varnothing $$ for $$ i \neq j $$.

In other words

> $$ P[A] = \sum\limits^m_{i=1} P[A_i] $$

**Theorem 1.4**

The probability measure $$P[.]$$ satisfies the following:

- $$P[\varnothing] = 0$$
- $$P[A^c] = 1 - P[A]$$
- For any A and B (not necessarily mutually exclusive) 
  - $$P[A \cup B] = P[A] + P[B] - P[A \cap B]$$
- $$A \in B \text{ then } P[A] \leq P[B] $$.

**Theorem 1.5**

The probability of an event $$B = {s_1, s_2, ..., s_m}$$ is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes contained in the event:

> $$ P[B] = \sum\limits^m_{i=1} P[{s_i}] $$


**Theorem 1.6**

For an experiment with sample space $$S = {s_1, \dots, s_n}$$ in which each outcome $$s_i$$ is equally likely:

> $$P[s_i] = \frac{1}{n}, 1\leq i\leq n$$

**Section 1.4 - Conditional Probability**


Definition, **Conditional Probability**: The probability of the event A given the occurrence of event B is:

 > $$ P[A|B] = \frac{P[AB]}{P[B]} = \frac{P[A\cap B]}{P[B]}$$
 
 The vertical bar, "$$\vert $$" stands for the word "given".
 
 What this equation does is "scale up" the probability of all events inside the event B. This effectively makes B the "new" sample space because all events that occur after B is given must be contained within B


**Theorem 1.7**

 A conditional probability measure $$P[A\vert B]$$ has the following properties that correspond to the axioms of probability.
 
 1. $$P[A|B] \geq 0$$
 2. $$P[B|B] = 1 $$
 3. If $$A=A_1\cup A_2\cup \dots $$ with $$A_i \cap A_j = \varnothing$$ for $$i\neq j$$ then 
   - $$P[A|B] = P[A_1|B] + P[A_2|B] + \dots$$
   
**Partitions and the Law of Total Probability**

**Theorem 1.8**

For a partition $$B = {B_1, B_2, \dots}$$ and any event A in the sample space, let $$C_i = A\cap B_i$$ for $$i \neq j$$ , the events $$C_i \text{and} C_j$$ are mutually exclusive and:

> $$ A = C_1 \cup C_2 \cup \dots$$

**Theorem 1.9**

For any event A, and partition $${B_1, B_2, \dots , B_m}$$

> $$P[A] = \sum\limits^m_{i=1} P[A\cap B_i] $$


**Theorem 1.10**

For a partition $${B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m}$$ with $$P[B_i] > 0$$ for all i, 

> $$ P[A] = \sum\limits^m_{i=1} P[A|B_i] P[B_i]$$

**Theorem 1.11:** Bayes' Theorem

> $$ P[B|A] = \frac{P[A|B] P[B]}{P[A]} $$

What this is saying is that the probability of an event B, given the event A, will be exactly equal to the probability of A divided by the probability of B, multiplied by the probability of A given B

**Section 1.6** Independence

**Definition**: Independence - Events A and B are independent if and only if:

> $$ P[AB] = P[A]P[B] $$


A comment on event independence and mutually exclusivity. The two are **not synonyms**. In some contexts they can have similar meanings. But in probability this is not the case. 

Mutually exclusive events A and B have no outcomes in common and therefore $$P[AB] = 0$$. **In most situations independent events are not mutually exclusive**.

Exceptions occur only when $$P[A] = 0 \text{ or } P[B] = 0$$. When we have to calculate probabilities, knowledge that events A and B are mutually exclusive is very helpful. Axiom 3 enables us to add their probabilities to obtain the probability of the _union_. Knowledge that events C and D are independent is also very useful. Definition 1.6 enables us to multiply their probabilities to obtain the probability of the _intersection_.

**Definition 1.7** - Three Independent Events

Three events are mutually independent if and only if:

- $$ A_1 \text{ and } A_2 $$ are independent
- $$ A_2 \text{ and } A_3 $$ are independent
- $$ A_1 \text{ and } A_3 $$ are independent

and finally as long as: $$ P[A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3] = P[A_1]P[A_2]P[A_3] $$



**Definition 1.8** More than two Independent Events

This definition is the same as above. All collections of events must be mutually exclusive of one another, 

The probability of intersections of these events must be equal to the product of their individual probabilities.

## Chapter 2 - Tree Diagrams

Below is an example problem which will introduce us to tree diagrams

---

![Tree Diagram Example Problem](/assets/images/probability/tree-diag-1.png)

---


From this we can see that tree diagrams help us to calculate probabilities of sequential events.

> Tree diagrams display the outcomes of the **subexperiments** in a _sequential experiment_. The labels of the branches are probabilities and conditional probabilities. The probability of an outcome of the entire experiment is the product of the probabilities of branches from the root of the tree to a leaf.


Many experiments will consist of what we call **subexperiments**. The procedure followed for each subexperiment may depend on the results of the previous subexperiments.

In doing this we will assemble outcomes into different partitions, starting at the root of the tree. From there we branch (and label according probabilities) based on the probabilities of each outcome.

### Section 2.2 - Counting Methods 

> In all application of probability theory, it should be important to understand the sample space of an experiment.

The methods in this section will help determine the number of outcomes in the sample space of an experiment.

**Theorem 2.1**

An experiment consists of two subexperiments. If one subexperiment has $$k$$ outcomes and the other subexperiment has $$n$$ outcomes, then the experiment has a total of $$nk$$ outcomes.


**Theorem 2.2**


The number of $$k$$-permutations of $$n$$ distinguishable objects is:

> $$(n)_k = n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)\dots(n-k+1)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} $$


Something that might help to remember permutations is that a **permutation depends on the order in which the elements are in** whereas a combination does not depend on the order.

For example, think if we had 100 students. Imagine that we want to put any 50 of those students into a line. This means that the number of _different_ **permutations** (arrangements) of that line is equal to $$\frac{100!}{(100-50)!}=\frac{100!}{50!}$$


**Theorem 2.3**

The number of ways to choose k objects out of n distinguishable objects is:

> $$\begin{pmatrix} n\\k \end{pmatrix} = \frac{(n)_k}{k!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

Sometimes this is called a **combination** where the order in which items are picked does not matter, as opposed to the **permutation**.


**Definition 2.1**: $$n$$ choose $$k$$

For any integer $$n \geq 0 $$, we define

> $$\begin{pmatrix} n \\ k \end{pmatrix} = \begin{cases} \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} & k = 0, 1, \dots, n, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} $$

**Theorem 2.4**

Given $$m$$ distinguishable object, there are $$m^n$$ ways to choose with replacement an ordered sample of $$n$$ objects.

**Theorem 2.5**

for $$n$$ repetitions of a subexperiment with sample space $$S_{sub} = \lbrace s_0, \dots, s_{m-1} \rbrace$$, the sample space $$S$$ of the sequential experiment has $$m^n$$ outcomes


**Theorem 2.6**

The number of observation frequencies for n subexperiments with sample space $$S = \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace$$ with 0 appearing $$n_)$$ times and 1 appearing $$n_1=n-n_0$$ times is $$\begin{pmatrix} n \\ n_1 \end{pmatrix} $$

**Theorem 2.7**

For $$n$$ repetitions of a subexperiment with sample space $$S = \{s_0,\dots,s_{m-1}\}$$ the number of length $$n = n_0 + \dots + n_{m-1}$$ observation sequences with $$s_i$$ appearing $$n_i$$ times is

> $$ \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n_0,\dots,n_{m-1} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{n_0!n_1!\dots n_{m-1}!} $$

### Independent Trials

**Theorem 2.8**

The probability of $$n_0$$ failures and $$n_1$$ successes in $$n=n_0+n_1$$ independent trials is:

> $$ P[E_{n_0}, n_1] = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n_1 \end{pmatrix} = (1-p)^{n-n_1}p^{n_1} = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n_0 \end{pmatrix} (1-p)^{n_0}p^{n-n_0} $$

## Chapter 3 - Discrete Random Variables

**Definition - Discrete Variables** - A random variable assigns numbers to outcomes in the sample space of an experiment.

A probability model always begins with an experiments. And each of the random variables is directly related to the experiment.

There are **3 types of relationships**

1. The random variable is the observation
2. The random variable is a function of the observation
3. The random variable is a function of another random variable.

Throughout most of the book probability is examined in models that assign numbers to the outcomes of the sample space. 

When we observe the observation we call it a _random variable_. Typically in our notation the name of our random variable is a capital letter. e.g. $$X$$.

The set of possible values for $$X$$ is the **range of $$X$$**

Since we often consider multiple variables at a time, we denote the range of a random variable by the letter $$S$$ with a subscript that is the name of the random variable.

Thus, $$S_X$$ is the range of the random variable $$X$$, $$S_Y$$ is the range of the random variable $$Y$$ and so on...


**Definition 3.1** 

**Random Variable** consists of an experiment with a probability measure $$P[.]$$ defined on a sample space $$S$$ and a _function that assigns a real number to each outcome in the sample space of the experiment._

A note on notation:

- On occasion should we need to identify the random variable $$X$$ with respect to a sample outcome, then we define this as $$X(s)$$. (In other words we define a function which relates the value of X to the outcomes - X is a function of $$s$$, the outcome)

- Sometimes we will write $$\{ X = x\} $$to emphasize that there is a set of sample points $$s \in S $$ for which $$X(s) = x$$.

We can then adopt the following shorthand notation:

> $$\{X = x\} = \{s\in S \ \vert\  X(s) = x\} $$

**Definition 3.2**

$$X$$ is a **discrete random variable** if the range of $$X$$ is a _countable set_

$$ S_X = \{x_1,x_2,\dots\} $$

**Definition 3.3**

**Probability Mass Function** (PMF) - The probability mass function of the discrete random variable X is 

> $$ P_X(x) = P[X=x] $$

A way of putting this is that for a certain discrete random variable which is described by $$P_X$$, then saying $$P_X(x)$$ is the probability of the event in which that $$x$$ occurs, or in other words it is $$P[X=x]$$, where the big $$X$$ is the random variable and $$P$$ simply denotes that it is the PMF function.

**Theorem 3.1**

For a discrete random variable $$X$$ with a PMF of $$P_X(x)$$ and range $$S_X$$ 

1. $$\text{For any } x, P_X(x) \geq 0$$
2. $$\sum\limits_{x\in S_X} P_X(x) = 1$$
3. For any event $$B\subset S_X$$, the probability that $$X$$ is in the set $$B$$ is 
  - $$P[B] = \sum\limits_{x\in B} P_X(x) $$
  
To put this into words we can say that to calculate the probability of an event, $$B$$, then it is the sum total probability of all outcomes for $$P_X$$ which are contained within $$B$$

### Families of Random Variables
  
- In practical applications, certain types of random variables appear over and over across many experiments.
- In each of these families (types) the PMF of all the random variables will have the same mathematical form
- Differ only in values of one or two parameters
- Depending on family, each PMF will contain only 1-2 parameters
- If we assign numbers to the parameters we can obtain a specific variable.
- Typical nomenclature for a family consists of the family name followed by one or two parameters in parentheses.

Example: _binomial(n, p)_ refers in general to the family of _binomial_ random variables

_Binomial(7, 0.1)_ refers to the binomial random variable with parameters $$n=7$$ and $$p = 0.1$$


**Definition 3.4**

X is a Bernoulli (p) random variable if the PMF of X has the form

> $$ P_X(x) = \begin{cases} 1-p , & x = 0 \\ p , & x = 1 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

 - $$X =$$ The number of successes in a single trial.

**Definition 3.5** Geometric (p) Random Variable

X is a geometric (p) random variable if the PMF of X has the form

> $$ P_X(x) = \begin{cases} p(1-p)^{x-1}, & x = 0 \\0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

- $$X =$$ Number of trials until (up to and including) the first success

**Definition 3.6** Binomial (n, p) Random Variable

X is a binomial (n, p) random variable if the PMF of X has the form 

> $$ P_X(x) = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ x \end{pmatrix} p^x(1-p)^{n-x} $$

Where $$ 0 < p < 1 $$ and $$n$$ is an integer such that $$ n \geq 1 $$

- $$X = $$ the number of successes in n trials

**Definition 3.7** Pascal (k, p) Random Variable

X is a pascal (k, p) random variable if the PMF of X has the form:

> $$ P_X(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x-1 \\ k-1 \end{pmatrix} p^k(1-p)^{x-k} $$

Where $$ 0 < p < 1 $$ and k is an integer such that $$k \geq 1$$

- $$X = $$ the number of trials until the $$k^{th}$$ success

If $$k = 1$$ then x is geometric.

- Bernoulli (p) = number successes in 1 trial
- Geometric (p) = number of trials until 1st success
- Binomial (n, p) = number of successes in n trials
- Pascal (k, p) = number of trials until k successes

|Name of Random Variable| Description of variable | PMF Function |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
|Bernoulli|number successes in 1 trial		|$$ P_X(x) = \begin{cases} 1-p , & x = 0 \\ p , & x = 1 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$|
|Geometric|number of trials until 1st success|$$ P_X(x) = \begin{cases} p(1-p)^{x-1}, & x = 0 \\0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$		|
|Binomial |number of successes in n trials	|$$ P_X(x) = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ x \end{pmatrix} p^x(1-p)^{n-x} $$						|
|Pascal   |number of trials until k successes|$$ P_X(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x-1 \\ k-1 \end{pmatrix} p^k(1-p)^{x-k} $$			  		|

**Definition 3.8** Discrete Uniform $$(k, l)$$ Random Variable

X is a **discrete uniform** $$(k, l)$$ random variable if the PMF of X has the form:

> $$ P_X(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{l - k + 1},\  x=k, k+1, k+2\dots \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

- X is uniformly distributed between $$k$$ and $$l$$.


**Definition 3.9** Poisson ($$\alpha$$) Random Variable

X is a poisson ($$\alpha$$) random variable if the PMF of X has the form

> $$P_X(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{\alpha^xe^{-\alpha}}{x!}, x=0,1,2\cdots \\0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

- Call the phenomena of interest an _arrival_.
- Poisson model specifies an average rate.
- $$\lambda$$ arrivals per second, over a time interval of $$T$$ seconds.
- The number of arrivals $$X$$ has a Poisson PMF with $$\alpha = \lambda T$$

### Section 3.4 - Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

> Like the PMF, the CDF of a random variable X expresses the probability model of an experiment as a mathematical function. The function is the probability $$P[X \leq x]$$ for every number $$x$$.

The **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) of a random variable, X, is 

$$ F_X(x) = P[X \leq x] $$


**Theorem 3.2**

- $$F_X(\infty) = P[X \leq \infty] = 1$$ - _The probability which X is less than infinity_.
- $$F_X(-\infty) = P[X \leq -\infty] = 0$$ - _The probability which X is less than infinity_.
- For all $$x' \geq x, F_X(x') \geq F_X(x)$$
- For $$x_i \in S_X$$ and $$\epsilon$$, and arbitrarily small positive number
  - $$F_X(x_i) - F_X(x_i - \epsilon) = P_X(x_i) $$
- $$F_X(x) = F_X(x_i)$$ for all x such that $$x_i \leq x < x_{i+1} $$

**Theorem 3.3**

For all $$b \geq a$$

> $$ F_X(b) - F_X(a) = P[a < X \leq b] $$

In other words, to find the probability of an event between two values, you can simply subtract the values of the CDF at $$a$$ and $$b$$ because it is the sum total probability up to each of those points, subtracting them results in only the probability of values between $$a$$ and $$b$$.

**Definition 3.13** Expected Value

The expected value of $$X$$ is 

$$ E[X]=\mu_X = \sum\limits_{x\in S_X}^\  xP_X(x)$$

This is sometimes referred to as the _mean_ of a random variable or function

**Theorem 3.4**

The Bernoulli $$p$$ random variable $$X$$ has the expected value $$E[X]=p$$


**Theorem 3.5** 

The geometric random variable $$X$$ has the expected value $$E[X]=\frac{1}{p}$$

**Theorem 3.6**

The Poisson ($$\alpha$$) random variable in definition 3.9 has the expected value $$E[X]=\alpha$$


**Theorem 3.7**

1\. For the binomial $$(n, p)$$ random variable $$X$$ of definition 3.6

$$ E[X] = np $$

2\. For the pascal $$(k, p)$$ random variable $$X$$ of definition 3.7

$$ E[X] = \frac{k}{p} $$

3\. For the discrete uniform $$(k, l)$$ random variable $$X$$ of definition 3.7

$$ E[X] = \frac{k+l}{2} $$

#### Expected Value Table

| Function Type | Expected Value $$E[X]$$ |
| Bernoulli | $$p$$ |
| Geometric | $$\frac{1}{p}$$ |
| Poisson | $$\alpha$$ |
| Binomial | $$np$$ |
| Pascal | $$\frac{k}{p}$$ |
| Discrete Uniform | $$\frac{k + l}{2}$$ |


**Theorem 3.8**

Perform $$n$$ Bernoulli trials. In each trial let the probability of success be $$\frac{\alpha}{n}$$ where $$\alpha > 0$$ is a constant and $$n > \alpha$$. Let the random variable $$K_n$$ be the number of successes in $$n$$ trials. As $$n\rightarrow \infty$$ then $$ P_{K_n}(k)$$ converges to the PMF of a Poisson $$(\alpha)$$ random variable

**Definition 3.11** Mode

A mode of random variable X is a number $$x_{mod}$$ satisfying $$P_X(x_{mod}) \geq P_X(x)$$ for all x

**Definition 3.12** Median

A median $$x_{med}$$ of random variable X is a number that satisfies these properties

1. $$P[X \leq x_{med}]\geq \frac{1}{2} $$
2. $$P[X\geq x_{med}] \geq \frac{1}{2} $$


### Functions of a Random Variable

**Definition 3.14**

Each sample value y of a derived random variable Y is a mathematical function $$g(x)$$ of a sample value x of another random variable X. We adopt the notation $$Y = g(X)$$ to describe the relationship of the two random variables.

**Definition 3.9**

For a discrete random variable X, the PMF of $$Y=g(X)$$ is

> $$ P_Y(y)=\sum\limits_{X:g(x)=y}^\ P_X(x) $$

### Expected Value of a Derived Random Variable

**Theorem 3.10**

Given a random variable X with the PMF $$P_X(x)$$ and derived random variable $$Y=g(X)$$, the expected value of $$Y$$ is

> $$ E[Y] = \mu_Y= \sum\limits_{x\in S_X}^\ g(x) P_X(x)$$


**Theorem 3.11**

For any random variable X, 

> $$ E[X-\mu_X] = 0$$

**Theorem 3.12**

For any random variable X, 

> $$ E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b $$

### Variance and Standard Deviation

**Definition 3.15** Variance

The variance of a random variable X is:

> $$ Var[X] = E[(X-\mu_X)^2] $$

You might have heard variance before as the square of standard deviation ($$\sigma$$). Thus follows the next definition.

**Definition 3.16** Standard Deviation

The standard deviation of a random variable X is:

> $$ \sigma_X = \sqrt{Var[X]} $$

**Theorem 3.13**

In the absence of observations, the minimum mean square error estimate of random variable X is:

> $$\hat{x} = E[X]$$


**Theorem 3.14**

> $$ Var[X] = E[X^2] - \mu_x^2 = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 $$

**Theorem 3.17**

For the Random variable, X

a. The nth moment is $$E[X^n]$$
b. The nth central moment is $$E[(X-\mu_X)^n] $$

**Theorem 3.15**

> $$ Var[aX + b] = a^2 Var[X] $$

## Chapter 4 - Continuous Random Variables

Example:

Imagine a circle with an **infinite amount of points around the circle**. If we were to pick any **one** point at random. What would the **probability of picking that point** be?

So what if we ask, what is the probability we choose the point of $$x = 0.25$$, or $$P[X=0.25]$$.

Well, it turns out, the answer, $$P[X=0.25] =  0$$. This will lead us into the first section

### Section 4.1 - Continuous Sample Space

In a **continuous sample space**, there are an infinite number of points you could choose. But the probability of picking a single point is zero.

### Section 4.2 - The Cumulative Distribution Function

**Definition 4.1** - Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

> $$ F_X(x) = P [ X \leq x] $$

Recall this from previous sections. It applies to continuous random variables as the probability of any single event is 0, but for all values up to and including a single value is how we calculate the probability of a continuous function.

**Theorem 4.1**

For any random variable X

1. $$ F_X(-\infty) = 0 $$ -- $$P[X \leq -\infty] = 0$$
2. $$ F_X(\infty) = 1 $$ -- $$P[X \leq \infty] = 0$$
3. $$ P[x_1 \leq X \leq x_2] =  F_X(x_2) - F_X(x_1)$$ 

**Definition 4.2** - Continuous Random Variable

> $$X$$ is a continuous random variable if the CDF $$F_X(x)$$ is a continuous function

### Section 4.3 - The Probability Density Function

The probability density function (PDF) of a continuous random variable X is:

> $$ f_X(x) = \frac{dF_X(x)}{dx} $$

This function is simply defined as the derivative of the CDF function for a continuous random variable.

**Theorem 4.2**

For a continuous random variable X with a PDF of $$f_X(x)$$

1. $$ f_X(x) \geq 0 \text{ for all } x$$
2. $$ F_X(x) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^x f_X(u)du$$
3. $$ \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x)dx = 1 $$

**Theorem 4.3**

> $$ P[x_1 < X \leq x_2] = \int\limits_{x_1}^{x_2} f_X(x)dx $$

### Section 4.4 - Expected Values

The expected value of a continuous random variable X is:

> $$ E[X] = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} xf_X(x)dx $$

**Theorem 4.4**

The expected value of a function $$g(X)$$ of a random variable X is:

> $$ E[g(x)] = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x)f_X(x)dx $$

**Theorem 4.5**

For any random variable $$X$$

- $$ E[X-\mu_X] = 0 $$
- $$ E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b$$
- $$ Var[X] = E[X^2] - \mu_X^2 $$
- $$ Var[aX + b] = a^2Var[X] $$


### Section 4.5 - Families of Continuous Random Variables

**Definition 4.5** Uniform Random Variable

X is a uniform (a, b) random variable if the PDF of X is 

> $$ f_X(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{b-a} & a \leq x < b, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$
						
Where the condition is that the parameter $$ b > a $$

**Theorem 4.6** 

If X is a uniform (a, b) random variable

- The CDF of X is: $$ F_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x \leq a \\ \frac{x-a}{b-a} & a < x \leq b \\ 1 & x > b \end{cases} $$
- The expected value of X is $$ E[X] = \frac{b + a}{2} $$
- The variance of X is $$ Var[X] = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12} $$

**Theorem 4.7**

Let X be a uniform $$(a, b)$$ random variable, where a and b are both integers. Let $$K = \lceil X\rceil $$. Then K is a discrete uniform $$(a+1, b)$$ random variable.

Note that $$\lceil X \rceil$$ is the "ceiling" of the range of X, or the greatest value in the set

**Definition 4.6** - Exponential Random Variable

X is an exponential ($$\lambda$$) random variable if the PDF of X is:

> $$ f_X(x) = \begin{cases} \lambda e^{-\lambda x} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}  \end{cases} $$

**Theorem 4.8**

If X is an exponential ($$\lambda$$) random variable

- The CDF of X is: $$ F_X(x) = \begin{cases} 1-e^{-\lambda x} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$
- The expected value of X is $$ E[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda} $$
- The variance of X is $$ Var[X] = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} $$

**Theorem 4.9**

If X is an exponential ($$\lambda$$) random variable, then $$K = \lceil X \rceil $$ is a geometric (p) random variable with $$p = 1 - e^{-\lambda}$$

**Definition 4.7** - Erlang Random Variable

X is an Erlang ($$n, \lambda $$) random variable if the PDF of X is:

> $$ f_X(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{\lambda^2 x^{n-1}e^{-\lambda x}}{(n-1)!} & x > 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

where the parameter of $$\lambda > 0$$ and the parameter $$n \geq 1$$ is an integer.

**Theorem 4.10**

If X is an Erlang ($$n, \lambda $$) random variable, then

- $$ E[X] = \frac{n}{\lambda} $$
- $$ Var[X] = \frac{n}{\lambda^2} $$


**Theorem 4.11**

Let $$K_{\alpha}$$ denote a Poisson ($$\alpha$$) random variable. For any $$x > 0$$, the CDF of an Erlang ($$n, \lambda$$) random variable X, satisfies

> $$ F_X(x) = 1 - F_{K_{\lambda x}}(n-1) = \begin{cases} 1 - \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac {(\lambda x)^k e^{-\lambda x}}{k!} & x \geq 0 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$


### Section 4.6 - Gaussian Random Variables

**Definition 4.8** - Gaussian Random Variable

$$X$$ is a Gaussian $$(\mu, \sigma)$$ random variable if the PDF of $$X$$ is:

> $$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2} $$

The parameter $$\mu$$ can be any real number and the parameter $$\sigma > 0$$

**Theorem 4.12**

If X is a Gaussian $$(\mu, \sigma)$$ random variable:

> $$ E[X] = \mu$$ and $$Var[X] = \sigma^2$$

**Theorem 4.13**

If X is a Gaussian $$(\mu, \sigma)$$ random variable, $$Y=aX + b$$ is Gaussian $$(a\mu + b, a\sigma)$$

**Definition 4.9** - Standard Normal Random Variable

The **standard normal** random variable $$Z$$ is the Gaussian (0, 1) random variable


**Definition 4.10** - Standard Normal CDF

The CDF of the **standard normal** random variable Z is:

> $$ \Phi (z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_{-\infty}^z e^{-u^2/2}du $$

**Theorem 4.14** - If X is a Gaussian $$(\mu, \sigma)$$ random variable, then the CDF of X is:

> $$ F_X(x) = \Phi (\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}) $$

And the probability that X is in the interval of (a, b] (includes b, excludes a):

> $$ P[a < X \leq b] = \Phi (\frac{b-\mu}{\sigma}) - \Phi (\frac{a - \mu}{\sigma}) $$

**Theorem 4.15**

> $$ \Phi(-z) = 1 - \Phi(z) $$


**Definition 4.11** - Standard Normal Complementary CDF

The standard normal complementary CDF is:

> $$ Q(z) = P[Z > z] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\limits_z^\infty e^{-e^2/2}du = 1 - \Phi (z) $$

Another way of looking at is is that $$Q(z) = \Phi (-z) = 1-\Phi (z) $$


### Section 4.7 - Delta Functions, Mixed Random Variables

**Definition 4.12** - Unit Step Function

The unit step function is:

> $$ u(x) = \begin{cases} 0, x < 0 \\ 1,  x \geq 0 \end{cases} $$

**Definition 4.12** - Unit Impulse (Delta) Function

Let

> $$ d_\epsilon (x) = \begin{cases} 1/\epsilon, & -\epsilon/2 \leq x \leq \epsilon/2 \\ 0 , & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

Then the unit impulse function is 

> $$ \delta (x) = \lim\limits_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0} d_\epsilon(x) $$

Now as $$\epsilon$$ approaches the delta function $$\delta (x)$$ for each $$\epsilon$$ the area under the curve of the $$d_{\epsilon} (x)$$ equals 1

![](/assets/images/probability/epsilon-delta.png)


**Theorem 4.16**

For any continuous function g(x)

> $$ \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x)\delta (x-x_0)dc = g(x_0)$$

**Theorem 4.17**

> $$\int\limits_{-\infty}^{x} \delta(v) dv = u(x) $$

## Chapter 5 - Multiviews and Pairs of Random Variables

### Pairs of Random Variables

We should consider experiments that produce a collection of random variables $$ X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$$.

A pair of random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is the same as the two dimensional vector, $$\pmb{X} = [X, Y]'$$ this way. Since the components of this vector are both random variables we call $$\pmb{X}$$ a random vector.

**Definition 5.1** - Joint Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The joint cumulative distribution function of random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is

> $$ F_{X,Y}(x, y) = P[X \leq x, Y \leq y] $$

So if you can imagine a two dimensional graph that the CDF represents the probability of being within a rectangular region which the point that is picked is $$\leq$$ x and y

**Theorem 5.1**

For any pair of random variables $$X, Y$$

- $$ 0 \leq F_{X,Y} \leq 1$$
- $$ F_{X,Y}(\infty, \infty) = 1 $$
- $$ F_{X}(x) = F_{X,Y}(x, \infty) $$
- $$ F_{Y}(y) = F_{X,Y}(\infty, y) $$
- $$ F_{X,Y}(x, -\infty) = 0 $$
- $$ F_{X,Y}(-\infty, y) = 0 $$
- If $$ x \leq x_1 \text{ and } y \leq y_1$$ then
  - $$ F_{X,Y}(x, y) \leq F_{X,Y}(x_1, y_1) $$

**Theorem 5.2**

> $$ P[x_1 \leq X \leq x_2, y_1 \leq Y \leq y_2] = F_{X,Y}(x_2, y_2) - F_{X,Y}(x_2, y_1) - F_{X,Y}(x_1, y_2) + F_{X,Y}(x_1, y_1) $$

**Definition 5.7** - Correlation

The correlation of two variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is 

> $$ r_{X, Y} = E[XY] $$

**Theorem 5.16**

- $$ Cov[X, Y] = r_{X, Y} - \mu_X\mu_Y$$.

## Chapter 10 - The Sample Mean

**Definition 10.1** - Sample Mean

**Theorem 10.1**

The sample mean $$M_n(X)$$ has the expected value and variance

Mean:

> $$ E[M_n(X)] = E[X] $$

Variance:

> $$ Var[M_n(X)] = \frac{Var[X]}{n} $$

A note on the sample variance: the the above theorem actually states that the sample mean $$M_n(X)$$ converges to the expected value $$E[X]$$ as the number of sample, $$n$$ approaches $$\infty$$

> $$P[\vert M_n(X) - \mu_X\vert < c] \geq 1- \frac{Var[X]}{nc^2} $$

**Theorem 10.6** The Weak Law of Large Numbers (Infinite Samples)

If $$X$$ has finite variance, then, for any constant $$c > 0$$

> $$\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} P[\vert M_n(X) - \mu_X \vert \geq c] = 0 $$
> $$\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} P[\vert M_n(X) - \mu_X \vert < c] = 1 $$

**Theorem 10.7**
