## Lecture 1 - Introduction

#### 1958: First integrated circuit
  
  - Flip-flop using two transistors @ Texas Instruments
  
In 50 years we went from 2 transistors to 55 million! This was driven by the miniaturization of transistors.

Computers have been increasing in speed and decreasing in size (really the transistors have!) since their inception in the 1950's and 60's

It has been followed by Gordon Moore's Law (more commonly known as Moore's Law) that the amount of transistors that could fit on a silicon die would double every 2 years. Surprisingly his law holds true almost all the way from the 1960s when he first predicted this, all the way until now (2014/2015)!

However one downside to this is that the power consumption of these chips have been increasing as well.

## Lecture 2 - Introduction 2

We want to lookat how these computers are structured and organized though. What exactly does it do?

- Instruction set, registers
  - MIPS, x86, Alpha, PIC, ARM
- Microarchitecture
  - Single cycle, multi-cycle, pipelined, superscalar?
- Logic: how are functional blocks constructed?
  - Ripple carry, carry look-ahead, carry select adders
- Circuit: how are transistors used?
  - Complementary CMOS, pass transistors, domino
- Physical
  - Chip layout

There are different classes of computers which we should consider.

- Desktop Computers
  - Designed to deliver good performance for a single user at a low cost. Typically use mouse and keyboard
  
- Servers
  - Used to run larger programs for multiple simultaneous users typically accessed only via a network and that places a greater emphasis on dependability and often security
  
- Supercomputers
  - A high performance, high cost class of servers with hundreds to thousands of processors, terabytes of memory and petabytes of storage that are used for high-end scientific and engineering applications

- Embedded Computers (Procesors)
  - A computer inside another device used for running one predetermined application

What happens below a program in a computer?

Usually it's written in a high-level language which was translated (compiled) from the programming language to machine code. From there the operating system is able to take the machine code and turn the machine code to service code which handles the input and output, memory management and storage, and scheduling tasks and sharing resources. 

All of these instructions are then sent to the Hardware (processor, memory, I/O controllers).

Most of this information in a computer is all translated into different languages. Usually you start at a High-Level language (c/java), it is then turned into assembly language, a textual representation of instructions for I/O and arithmetic, etc.. Assembly is then translated into binary bits (1's and 0's).

An **assembler** is analagous to a compiler in that it translates the assembly language into binary machine languages.

Computers are really just large abstractions of many different components of a computer. I/O components

- Controllers need to have:
  - Ability to input instructions from memory
  - logic and means to control instruction sequencing
  - logic and means to issue signals that control the way information flows between datapath components
  - Logic and means to control which operations are performed
- Datapath needs to have:
  - Components - functional units (e.g. adder) and storage locations (e.g. register file) - are needed to execute instructions
  - Components interconnected so that the instructions can be accomplished
  - Ability to load data from and store data into memory
  
  1. Processors _fetch_ instructions from memory
  2. The controller decodes the instruction to determine _what_ to execute
  3. Datapath will then _execute_ the intruction as directed by the controller
  4. Upon completion the data output will be _stored in memory_
  5. The output device will then _output_ the data

But what exactly is the interface between the software and the hardware?

It is the **instruction set**

### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

- It is the actual programmer-visible instruction set
- Boundary between software and hardware
- Decisions regarding
  - Class of ISA
    - Register memory ISA (memory can be accessed by many different instructions)
    - Load-store ISA (only load/store instructions can access memory)
  - Memory addressing (byte addressable)
  - Addressing modes (register, immediate, displacement, ...)
  - Instruction operands (size/type)
  - Operations (data transfer, arithmetic/logical, control, floating point)
  - Control flow instructions (connditiona/uncondfitional branches, call/return)
  - Instruction encoding (fixed/variable length)
