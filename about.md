#####*Hey! You've found the About Me page!*

My name is Zac. I'm an aspiring software engineer. I love computers and I love learning. I'm currently a student studying electrical and computer engineering at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, expected graduation 2018.

I work mainly with Java, python, C#, html, css, and javascript, but I try to branch into new languages when I can. Check out my projects page 

I try to make posts as often as I can, time permitting.

If you'd like to check out my projects, please head over to my projects page and find one you might like. Everything is open source!

Take a look around! Enjoy.
