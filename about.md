![Image of Myself](../assets/images/homepage/profile-pic.jpg)

My name is Zac (yes I spell it Z-A-C). I'm an aspiring software engineer. I'm currently a student studying electrical and computer engineering at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I expect to graduate around May of 2018. I hope to eventually attend graduate school after I finish my undergraduate degree.

My interests lie in big data analytics (mainly hadoop), machine learning, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.

I also love to learn and I love teaching people. I believe education is extremely important to our society. I am a [learning assistant at Rutgers University](https://rlc.rutgers.edu/student-info/group-and-individual-academic-support/learning-assistant-program) helping to teach undergraduate students introductory Physics courses.



Here's a list of languages and technologies I've worked with in the past:

* Java
* Python
* Hadoop
* C#
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Node.js
