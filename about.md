![me in my natural habitat]({{ "/assets/images/zac.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I'm a passionate, dedicated researcher and software engineer. My current
interests lie in high performance data analysis, distributed systems, operating
systems, and custom hardware accelerators.

I'm a firm believer in the value of education. I also enjoy helping others
learn! I spent 3 years at Rutgers University as a [learning
assistant](https://rlc.rutgers.edu/services/learning-assistant-program) where I
helped lead recitations and study groups in physics (01:750:123 and 124) and
data structures (01:198:112) and even [received an
award](http://studentawards.rutgers.edu/2018/05/01/zachary-blanco/) for my
work.

Currently, I am a PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) where I
perform research with [WukLab](https://wuklab.io). Please reach out if you would
like to discuss any of my research.
