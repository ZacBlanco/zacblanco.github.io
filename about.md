I'm an aspiring software engineer who's currently a student studying electrical and computer engineering at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I expect to graduate around May of 2018.

My interests lie in big data, distributed systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence. I'm currently working in the Paramathics group at Rutgers University with professor [Maryam Mehri Dehnavi](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~mm2366/). During the summer of 2018 I will work for a second time a 3-month stint at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

I'm a firm believer in great education. I enjoy helping others learn! I am currently a [learning assistant at Rutgers University](https://rlc.rutgers.edu/services/learning-assistant-program). I've helped lead recitations and study groups in physics (01:750:123 and 124) and data structures (01:198:112).

Here's a list of languages and technologies I've worked with in the past:

- Java
- Python
- Hadoop Ecosystem Projects: Knox, Ambari, Zeppelin, Hive, HDFS, Ranger, NiFi
- Apache Spark
- C#
