![Image of Myself](../assets/images/homepage/profile-pic.jpg)

I'm a passionate, dedicated researcher and software engineer. My interests lie in big data, distributed systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I'm a firm believer in the value of education. I also enjoy helping others learn! I spent 3 of my 4 years at Rutgers University as a [learning assistant](https://rlc.rutgers.edu/services/learning-assistant-program) where I helped lead recitations and study groups in physics (01:750:123 and 124) and data structures (01:198:112) and even [received an award](http://studentawards.rutgers.edu/2018/05/01/zachary-blanco/) for my contributions.

Here's a list of languages and technologies I've worked with in the past:

- Java
- Python
- Apache projects: Knox, Ambari, Zeppelin, Hive, HDFS, Ranger, NiFi, Hadoop, Spark
- C#
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Git + GitHub
- Linux
- C/C++
