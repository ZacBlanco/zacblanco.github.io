My name is Zac (yes I spell it Z-A-C). I'm an aspiring software engineer. I'm currently a student studying electrical and computer engineering at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. I expect to graduate around May of 2018. I hope to eventually attend graduate school after I finish my undergraduate degree.

My interests lie in big data, analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.

I'm also a firm believer in great education. I enjoy helping others learn! I am currently a [learning assistant at Rutgers University](https://rlc.rutgers.edu/student-info/group-and-individual-academic-support/learning-assistant-program). I help teach undergraduate students in introductory Physics courses.

Here's a list of languages and technologies I've worked with in the past:

- Java
- Python
- Hadoop Components: Knox, Ambari, Zeppelin, Hive, HDFS, Ranger, NiFi, Solr
- Apache Spark
- C#
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Git + GitHub
