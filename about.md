I'm a passionate, dedicated researcher and software engineer. My interests lie in big data, distributed systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I'm a firm believer in the value of education. I also enjoy helping others learn! I spent 3 of my 4 years at Rutgers University as a [learning assistant](https://rlc.rutgers.edu/services/learning-assistant-program) where I helped lead recitations and study groups in physics (01:750:123 and 124) and data structures (01:198:112) and even [received an award](http://studentawards.rutgers.edu/2018/05/01/zachary-blanco/) for my contributions.

Currently, I am a PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) where I perform research with [WukLab](https://wuklab.io)

Here's a short list of languages and technologies I've worked with in the past:

- Languages: Java, Scala, Python, C#, Typescript, C, C++, Rust, Go, Javascript, HTML, SQL, Bash
- Frameworks: React, Django, Akka
- Software: Linux, Docker, eBPF, Presto, Alluxio, Apache Hive, HDFS, Ranger, NiFi, Hadoop, Spark
