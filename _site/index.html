If there are concepts that don’t reside within equations, they will be explained nearest to the equations I feel are most related to that concept.</p>

<h2 id="rotational-dynamics">Rotational Dynamics</h2>

<h5 id="torque">Torque</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\tau = Fl = I\alpha</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Torque <script type="math/tex">\tau</script> is equal to the perpendicular force along the moment arm applied a distance, <script type="math/tex">l</script>  from a rotational axis.</p>

<h5 id="kinetic-energy-of-rolling-body">Kinetic Energy of Rolling Body</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">KE = \frac{1}{2}mv_{cm}^2 + \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The total kinetic energy of a body in rolling motion is equal to the sum of the translational kinetic energy and the rotational kinetic energy.</p>

<h5 id="rotational-to-translational-velocity">Rotational to Translational Velocity</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_{cm} = R\omega</script>
</blockquote>

<p>To convert from angular velocity to translational velocity, simply multiply the radius of the object <script type="math/tex">R</script> by the angular velocity.</p>

<h5 id="rotational-work">Rotational Work</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">W = \tau\Delta\theta</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The angular version of <script type="math/tex">W = Fd</script>. A toque multiple by the distance rotated in radians.</p>

<h5 id="power-of-rotation">Power of Rotation</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = \tau\omega</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The power applied is the angular version of <script type="math/tex">P = Fv</script>. Toque, <script type="math/tex">\tau</script> multiplied by the angular velocity, <script type="math/tex">\omega</script>.</p>

<h5 id="angular-momentum">Angular Momentum</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">L = I\omega = rmv\cdot sin(\phi)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Angular momentum is the angular version of normal momentum. It is equal to the moment of inertia multiplied by its angular velocity. This can also be translated to the normal momentum, <script type="math/tex">p = mv</script>, multiplied by the velocity at angle <script type="math/tex">\phi</script> from the perpendicular of the ‘moment arm’ to the object,</p>

<h5 id="conservation-of-angular-momentum">Conservation of Angular Momentum</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">I_1\omega_1 = I_2\omega_2</script>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is <em>NO</em> net toque applied to an object, the angular momentum in conserved. That is, th <script type="math/tex">L_1</script> (initial state) should be equal to <script type="math/tex">L_2</script> (final state).</p>

<h2 id="gravitation">Gravitation</h2>

<h5 id="gravitational-constant">Gravitational Constant</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">G = 6.67 \cdot 10^{-11}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This is Newton’s constant of gravitation. Used in the equations to follow.</p>

<h5 id="graviational-force-of-two-bodies">Graviational Force of Two Bodies</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This equation tells us that two bodies exert the same force on each other based on one objects mass, <script type="math/tex">m</script>, the other objects mass, <script type="math/tex">M</script>, and the distance between the two objects centers of gravity.</p>

<h5 id="potential-energy-of-gravitation">Potential Energy of Gravitation</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">U = \frac{GMm}{r}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The potential energy of one body with respect to another.</p>

<h5 id="finding--g--on-earth-and-other-planets">Finding <script type="math/tex">g</script> on Earth and Other Planets</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">g = \frac{GM_E}{R_E^2}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>We can find the value for the gravitational acceleration at the surface (or distance from that planet for that matter) so long as we know the planet’s mass, <script type="math/tex">M</script>, and the distance between the object and the center of the planet, <script type="math/tex">R</script>.</p>

<h5 id="circular-orbit-velocity">Circular Orbit Velocity</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_{orbit} = \sqrt{\frac{GM_E}{R}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>We can derive this value by setting the values for centripetal force (<script type="math/tex">\frac{mv^2}{r})</script> equal to <script type="math/tex">\frac{GMm}{r^2}</script>. Solving for v, we find that the velocity in a circular orbit depends only on the mass of the planet and the orbit distance from the <em>center of the planet</em> (not the surface).</p>

<h5 id="period-of-orbit">Period of Orbit</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = \frac{2\pi r^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\sqrt{GM_E}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply the time it takes to make one revolution given velocity v. Second equation is derived from Kepler’s law (see below).</p>

<h5 id="keplers-law-of-equal-areas">Kepler’s Law of Equal Areas</h5>

<blockquote>
  <p><script type="math/tex">\frac{dA}{dt} = rv\cdot sin\phi</script> s</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="../assets/images/physics-review/kepler-areas.png" alt="Kepler's Law of Equal Areas" /></p>

<p>Kepler’s Law of Equal Areas. In equal units of time, the area a planet sweeps out in a triangle along its orbit path will always be equal to each other.</p>

<h5 id="keplers-law-of-orbits">Kepler’s Law of Orbits</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GM}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This eqation relates the period is takes for a planet to orbit with the semi-major axis, <script type="math/tex">a</script> (or <script type="math/tex">r</script> if orbit is circular), and the mass of the object, <script type="math/tex">M</script> that a planet or body is orbiting.</p>

<h5 id="total-energy-of-a-body-in-orbit">Total Energy of a Body in Orbit</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">E_T = -\frac{GMm}{2R}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The total energy for a body in orbit (<script type="math/tex">KE + U</script>) is equal to the above equation.</p>

<h2 id="oscillation-and-periodic-motion">Oscillation and Periodic Motion</h2>

<h5 id="frequency">Frequency</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">f = \frac{1}{T}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Frequency is defined as the amount of rotations/oscillations per second. units of <script type="math/tex">s^{-1}</script>.</p>

<h5 id="period">Period</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = \frac{1}{f}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The period is simply the inverse of frequency. It is measured in seconds. As in, seconds per oscillation.</p>

<h5 id="angular-frequency">Angular Frequency</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\omega = 2\pi f</script>
</blockquote>

<p>angular frequency is a quantity measured in radians per second (<script type="math/tex">\frac{rad}{s}</script>). It is used frequently. The magnitude of angular velocity.</p>

<h5 id="hookes-law">Hooke’s Law</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">F = -kx</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Hooke’s law related the force that a spring pulls on an object given a spring’s stiffness (k) and the distance the object is pulled from equilibrium on the spring.</p>

<h5 id="angular-frequency-spring-constant">Angular Frequency (Spring Constant)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>We can calculate the angular frequncy of a mass on a spring by the above equation.</p>

<h5 id="period-of-an-oscillating-object-on-a-spring">Period of an Oscillating Object on a Spring</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, because we know <script type="math/tex">\omega =  2\pi f</script>, we can solve for the period too.</p>

<h5 id="total-energy-in-shm">Total Energy in SHM</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">E_T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The total energy in SHM is equal to the kinetic energy of an object plus its potential energy. This should always sum to a constant value so long as no energy is lost in the system. It should also be equal to the value <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{2}kA^2</script> because that is the max potential energy when the object is moved from displacement.</p>

<h5 id="maximum-velocity-in-shm">Maximum Velocity in SHM</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_{max} = \omega A</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The maximum velocity for any object in SHM is just the angular frequency multiplied by the amplitude of motion.</p>

<h5 id="maximum-acceleration-in-shm">Maximum Acceleration in SHM</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">a_{max} = \omega^2A</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The maximum accleration is similar to velocity where it is related to angular frequency and amplitude.</p>

<h5 id="displacement-of-shm">Displacement of SHM</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = A\cdot cos(\omega t + \phi)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The following equation gives us the displacement of any object at time <script type="math/tex">t</script> in SHM. Because we know that the max value of <script type="math/tex">cos\theta</script> is 1, then the max displacement is the amplitude, A, which it should be. This same concept will follow to the next two equations also.</p>

<h5 id="velocity-of-shm">Velocity of SHM</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = -\omega A\cdot sin(\omega t + \phi)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Because velocity is the derivative of displacement with respect to time, this equation is simply the derivative of the previous one.</p>

<h5 id="acceleration-of-shm">Acceleration of SHM</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">a = -\omega^2A\cdot cos(\omega t + \phi)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, similar to the above equation this equation is the derivative of the velocity equation with respect to time.</p>

<h3 id="pendulums">Pendulums</h3>

<h4 id="simple-pendulums">Simple Pendulums</h4>

<p>A simple pendulum is a pendulum in which the mass of the string is neglected (or it is too small in comparison to make a noticable difference).</p>

<h5 id="angular-frequency-simple-pendulum">Angular Frequency (Simple Pendulum)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Angular frequency of a simple pendulum is proportional to the gravitational acceleration, <script type="math/tex">g</script> and the length of the pendulum <script type="math/tex">L</script>.</p>

<h5 id="period-simple-pendulum">Period (Simple Pendulum)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>We know <script type="math/tex">\omega = 2\pi f</script>, so we can solve for Period and we find that it’s a pretty simple equation.</p>

<h4 id="physical-pendulums">Physical Pendulums</h4>

<p>Real pendulums are pendulum where all of the mass if <em>NOT</em> concentrated at the end of the string (or arm). <script type="math/tex">m</script> is the total mass of the pendulum. <script type="math/tex">g</script> is the constant of gravitation. <script type="math/tex">d</script> is the distance from the axis of rotation to the center of gravity of the pendulum. <script type="math/tex">I</script> is the moment of inertia of the whole pendulum.</p>

<h5 id="angular-frequency-physical-pendulum">Angular Frequency (Physical Pendulum)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\omega = \sqrt{\frac{mgd}{I}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Angular frequency for a real pendulum is defined above.</p>

<h5 id="period-physical-pendulum">Period (Physical Pendulum)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{I}{mgd}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar to a simple pendulum, we can also solve for period if we know the angular frequency.</p>

<h2 id="mechanical-waves">Mechanical Waves</h2>

<h5 id="velocity-of-a-wave">Velocity of a Wave</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = \lambda f</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The velocity of any wave is equal to the above.</p>

<h5 id="velocity-of-waves-on-a-string">Velocity of Waves on a String</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">v =  \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>We can find the velocity of any wave on a string if we know the tension that the string is under, <script type="math/tex">F</script>, and the linear density of the string, <script type="math/tex">\mu</script>. Linear density is measured in <script type="math/tex">\frac{kg}{m}</script> or <script type="math/tex">\frac{mass}{distance}</script>.</p>

<h5 id="wave-number">Wave Number</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply the equation for wave number.</p>

<h5 id="displacement-of-a-mechanical-wave">Displacement of a Mechanical Wave</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">y(x, t) = A\cdot cos(kx - \omega t)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This equation tells us the vertical displacement, <script type="math/tex">y</script>, from equilibrium of any point on a string moving left to right, given the x position on the string, and the time t, since it oscillating.</p>

<h5 id="principle-of-superposition">Principle of Superposition</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">y(x, t) = y_1(x, t) + y_2(x, t)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the principle of superposition. This basically says that any two waves traveling on the same string will sum their displacements together when traveling to form the new displacement from equilibrium</p>

<h5 id="displacement-of-2-standing-waves-on-a-string">Displacement of 2 Standing Waves on a String</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">y(x, t) = 2A\cdot sin(kx)sin(\omega t)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>If there are two standing waves on a string, the equation for the displacement from equilibrium become the following.</p>

<h5 id="average-power-of-a-wave">Average Power of a Wave</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">P_{ave} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{F\mu}\omega^2A^2</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This equation describes the average amount of power used by a string to make a wave with amplitude <script type="math/tex">A</script></p>

<h5 id="fundamental-frequencies-of-a-wave-on-a-string">Fundamental Frequencies of a Wave on a String</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_n = \frac{nv}{2L}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>A wave cannot exist on a string unless half of a wavelength is equal to a multiple of the length of the string. Because a fixed string with tension, <script type="math/tex">F</script> and linear density <script type="math/tex">\mu</script> doesn’t change, there are only certain frequencies that can be played on a string. These are called the fundamental frequencies. <script type="math/tex">n = 1, 2, 3...</script>, v is the velocity that the waves travel on the string. <script type="math/tex">L</script> is the length of the string.</p>

<h2 id="sound">Sound</h2>

<h5 id="maximum-pressure-of-a-sound-wave">Maximum Pressure of a Sound Wave</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">P_{max} = BkA</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The maximum pressure of a sound wave depends on Bulk’s modulus, <script type="math/tex">B</script>, the amplitude of the sound, and, <script type="math/tex">k</script>, the wave number.</p>

<h5 id="velocity-of-a-sound-wave">Velocity of a Sound Wave</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The velocity of sound is based on the Bulk modulus of the medium and the density of the medium, <script type="math/tex">\rho</script>.</p>

<h5 id="threshold-of-hearing-intensity">Threshold of Hearing Intensity</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">I_0 = 10^{-12} \frac{W}{m^2}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The threshold of human hearing for sound intensity is equal to the above value. it is a constant.</p>

<h5 id="intensity-in-decibels">Intensity in Decibels</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\beta = 10dB\cdot log(\frac{I}{I_0})</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Intensity is normally measured on a log scale that we call <em>Decibels</em>. The equation describes the intensity in decibels using the <script type="math/tex">I</script> values.</p>

<h5 id="relations-of-sound-intensity">Relations of Sound Intensity</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">I \propto \frac{1}{r^2} \propto A^2</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Sound intensity is proportional to the amplitude of the sound wave being produced and the distance from the source at which the listener hears the sound. That is to double the distance from the source of a sound, you would have an intensity decrease of approximately <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{4}</script> that of the original.</p>

<h5 id="fundamental-frequencies-open-pipe">Fundamental Frequencies (Open Pipe)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_n = \frac{nv}{2L}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>There are fundamental frequencies for sound in open pipes (one with openings at each end). Similar to a string. we need only the speed of sound and the length of the pipe to calculate the fundamental frequencies.</p>

<h5 id="fundamental-frequencies-stopped-pipe">Fundamental Frequencies (Stopped Pipe)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_n = \frac{nv}{4L}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar to the above, this equation is for a stopped pipe (one end open, the other closed). We can calculate the fundamental frequncies for any pipe with length L.</p>

<p>See below for visualization.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/physics-review/sound-fund-freq.gif" alt="Fundamental Frequencies in Pipes" /></p>

<h5 id="beat-frequency">Beat Frequency</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_{beat} = f_b - f_a</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Two different sound frequencies create what we call ‘beats’. It is addional amplitude variations in the sound we hear. See below image.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/physics-review/beat-freq.jpeg" alt="Image of Beat" /></p>

<h5 id="the-doppler-effect">The Doppler Effect</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">f_L = f_S(\frac{v + v_L}{v + v_S})</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The doppler effect tells us that the frequency a listener hears when they, or a source is moving to or away from the listener changes based on the velocity.</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">v_L</script> is positive if the listener moves toward the source.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">v_L</script> is negative if the listener moves away from the source.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">v_S</script> is positive if the source moves away from the listener</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">v_S</script> is negative if the source moves toward the listener</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fluid-mechanics">Fluid Mechanics</h2>

<h5 id="definition-of-density">Definition of Density</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rho = \frac{m}{V}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply defining density as amount of mass per unit of volume</p>

<h5 id="pressure-on-bernoullis-equation">Pressure (on Bernoulli’s Equation)</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = P_0 + \rho gh +</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The pressure given density of the fluid and changes in height are given by this equation.</p>

<h5 id="definition-of-pressure">Definition of Pressure</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = \frac{F}{A}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>We define pressure here as force per unit of area.</p>

<h5 id="definition-of-flow-rate">Definition of Flow Rate</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{V}{t} = Av</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The flow rate of a fluid is defined by the Volume, <script type="math/tex">V</script>, of fluid that passes through a given point in a unit of time, <script type="math/tex">t</script></p>

<h5 id="continuity-of-flow-rate">Continuity Of Flow Rate</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">A_1v_1 = A_2v_2 >> \frac{A_1}{A_2} = \frac{v_2}{v_1}</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This equation is basically telling us that for a pipe flowing with an incompressible fluid inside, the velocity multiplied by the cross sectional area should be exactly the same.</p>

<h5 id="equal-pressures-and-forces">Equal Pressures and Forces</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">A_1F_2 = A_2F_1</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This equation relates the cross-sectional area of a pipe and the force pushing against the pipe at two different point on level ground must be equal.</p>

<h5 id="difference-in-pressure-due-to-height">Difference in Pressure due to Height</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">P_2 - P_1 = -\rho g(y_2 - y_1)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This equation tells us the difference in pressure to to a change in height, h of the pipe.</p>

<h5 id="bernoullis-equation">Bernoulli’s Equation</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">p_1 + \rho gh_1 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2_1 = p_1 + \rho gh_2 + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2_2 = constant</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernoulli’s equation tells us that the pressure and velocity of any two points in a pipe system are related. Remember higher pressure means lower velocity. Lower pressure means higher velocity.</p>

<h5 id="force-of-buoyancy">Force of Buoyancy</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">F_B = \rho gV</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The force of buoyancy that an object experiences is directly related to the volume of the object submerged in water and the density of the water displaced.</p>

<p><em>Remember</em>: if an object floats in water, not fully submerged, the bouyant force is still equal to the weight of the object.</p>

<h2 id="temperature-and-heat">Temperature and Heat</h2>

<h5 id="temperature-in-fahrenheit">Temperature in Fahrenheit</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This equation is used to convert Temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. <script type="math/tex">T_F</script> is the temperature in Fahrenheit and <script type="math/tex">T_C</script> is the temperature in Celsius.</p>

<h4 id="heat-capacities">Heat Capacities</h4>

<p>Using the theory behind the kinetic energy of a particle, we can estimate the heat capacities of simple gases that have <em>constant volume</em>. It is important that we note this is with constant volume.</p>

<h5 id="monatomic-gas">Monatomic Gas</h5>

<p>The total Energy of a solid is equal to <script type="math/tex">3nRT</script>.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-law-of-thermodynamics">The First Law of Thermodynamics</h2>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}pdV</script>
</blockquote>

<p>The amount of work done by a gas at pressure, p, is equal to the integral from one volume to another of <script type="math/tex">p</script>.  This is the general equation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">W = p(V_2 - V_1)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>At constant pressure, the work done is simply the pressure (in pascals), multipled by the difference of the two states of volume.</p>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">W = nRT\cdot ln(\frac{V_2}{V_1}) = nRT\cdot ln(\frac{p_1}{P_2})</script>
</blockquote>

<p>To derive this, from the ideal gas law, <script type="math/tex">P = \frac{NRT}{V}</script>. If we replace P with this value in our integral, we find that <script type="math/tex">W = nRT \int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{dV}{V}</script>. This is how we find the equation. All units are in SI. Also, because <script type="math/tex">\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{p_1}{p_2}</script>, we get the second form of this equation.</p>

<h4 id="the-first-law-of-thermodynamics-1"><em>The First Law of Thermodynamics</em></h4>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">U_2 - U_1 = \Delta U = Q - W</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This is considered <em>The First Law of Thermodynamics</em>. It is essential to understand this. Basically this equation related the amount of heat added to (or lost) by a gas, and the amount of work done on/by the gas. We can find the change in internal energy between any two states by this equation. <script type="math/tex">\Delta U</script> is the change in internal energy between two states. <script type="math/tex">Q</script> is the amount of heat added or lost by a gas. <script type="math/tex">W</script> is the amount of work. It is important to note the sign convention. Adding heat to a gas denotes <script type="math/tex">+Q</script>. Taking heat away is <script type="math/tex">-Q</script>. Work done <em>by the gas</em> denotes <script type="math/tex">+W</script>. If the work is done <em>on the gas</em>, then we have <script type="math/tex">-W</script>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Delta U = Q - p\Delta V</script>
</blockquote>

<p>If gas is at a constant pressure and volume is changing, we know that the <script type="math/tex">W = p\Delta V</script> so that gives us this equation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Delta U = nC_V\Delta T</script>
</blockquote>

<p>For a gas at constant volume and a changing temperature (isobaric), we can relate a small change in the internal energy <script type="math/tex">\Delta U</script> to the Molar heat capacity at constant volume</p>

<h6 id="adiabatic-process">Adiabatic Process</h6>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Delta U = -W</script>
</blockquote>

<p>In n adiabatic process, heat is not lost or gained, therefore the change in internal energy is simply the work done by the system.</p>

<h5 id="isochoric-process">Isochoric Process</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Delta U = Q</script>
</blockquote>

<p>An isochoric process means that there is no change in volume. If there is no change in volume, then the system can’t be doing any work, which means <script type="math/tex">W = 0</script>. Therefore our change in internal energy must only be the heat added to the system.</p>

<h5 id="isobaric-process">Isobaric Process</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">W = p\Delta V</script>
</blockquote>

<p>In an isobaric process, the pressure is constant, which means we can relate the amount of work done by a gas to be <script type="math/tex">p\Delta V</script>.</p>

<h5 id="isothermal-process">Isothermal Process</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Delta U = 0 \therefore Q = W</script>
</blockquote>

<p>In an isothermal process there is no change in the temperature of the system. Therefore is there isn’t a change in the temperature, then the change in internal energy <script type="math/tex">\Delta U = 0</script>.</p>

<h5 id="heat-capcity-at-a-constant-pressure">Heat capcity at a constant pressure</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">C_p = C_V + R</script>
</blockquote>

<p>We find the molar heat capacity for a gas at constant pressure (not volume) is simply equal to its molar heat capacity at constant volume plus the gas constant, <script type="math/tex">R</script>.</p>

<h5 id="ratio-of-heat-capacities">Ratio of Heat Capacities</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_V}</script>
</blockquote>

<p><script type="math/tex">\gamma</script> is the ratio of heat capacities which is simply the molar heat capacity at constant pressure over the molar heat capacity at constant volume.</p>

<h4 id="work-done-in-adiabatic-processes">Work Done in Adiabatic Processes</h4>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">W = nC_V(T_1 - T_2)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>In an adiabatic process we can find the work done by a gas to be equal to the number of moles of the gas, multipled by the molar heat capacity at constant volume multiplied byh the change in temperature from two states, <script type="math/tex">\Delta T</script>. Note that temperature should be in Kelvin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">W = \frac{C_V}{R}(p_1V_1 - p_2V_2)</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Again in an adiabatic process we rearrange what we have above we can find that the work done over two states is equal to the <script type="math/tex">C_V</script> multiplied by the pressures and volumes at each state of the gas.</p>

<h2 id="the-second-law-of-thermodynamics">The Second Law Of Thermodynamics</h2>

<p>Any device that can turn heat into Work, is called a <em>heat engine</em>. All engines absorb heat form some resevoir at a higher temperature, use that heat to do work, and discard some heat at a lower temperature. That is the net heat <script type="math/tex">Q</script> of a engine process is equal to <script type="math/tex">W</script>. <script type="math/tex">Q = W</script>.</p>

<p>We can visualize he cycle with the following image:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/physics-review/carnot-cycle.gif" alt="Image of Carnot Cycle" /></p>

<h5 id="net-heat-absorbed-in-an-engine-cycle">Net Heat Absorbed in an Engine Cycle</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">Q = |Q_H| - |Q_C|</script>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the amount of heat that is transferred into work. Because <script type="math/tex">Q = W</script>, the amount of work done in an engine cycle is the difference of the absolute values of the heats <script type="math/tex">Q_C</script> and <script type="math/tex">Q_H</script></p>

<h5 id="thermal-efficiency-of-an-engine">Thermal Efficiency of an Engine</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">e = \frac{W}{Q_H} = 1 + \frac{Q_C}{Q_H} = 1 - \left|\frac{Q_C}{Q_H}\right|</script>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we know from above that <script type="math/tex">Q_C</script> can never be zero, this means that <script type="math/tex">W</script> is always less than <script type="math/tex">Q_H</script>. This leaves us with the fact that our engine efficiency, <script type="math/tex">e</script> <em>MUST</em> be less than 1. It is impossible to have an efficiency of 1 or greater.</p>

<h5 id="thermal-efficiency-in-an-otto-cycle">Thermal Efficiency in an Otto Cycle</h5>

<blockquote>
  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">e = 1- \frac{1}{r^{\gamma - 1}}</script>

<p>Remember <script type="math/tex">\gamma</script> is defined as the ratio of heat capacities at constant volume and pressure (see earlier).</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/physics-review/otto-cycle.png" alt="Image of Otto Cycle" /></p>

<p>Above is an image detailing a <script type="math/tex">pV</script> diagram of a normal Otto Cycle. From A to B there is an adiabatic compression (no heat lost). B to C we have heat added into the system with constant pressure and some volume change (This means some work is done). Point C to D there is the power stroke. The gas expands at somewhat constant temperature doing as much work as is can while pressure decreases. Then from point D to A the extra heat is exhausted as the gas cools in temperature. It also drops in pressure while volume remains constant.</p>

<h5 id="work-and-heat-in-refrigeration">Work and Heat in Refrigeration</h5>

<p>We can think of a refrigerator as simply a heat engine, but reversed. Instead of the hot resevoir letting heat out to do work, a refrigerator will have a cold resevoir, add work into the system, and exhaust more heat.</p>

<h5 id="efficiency-of-refrigeration">Efficiency of Refrigeration</h5>
