    <time datetime="2015-03-20T15:45:08-04:00" class="post-date">20 Mar 2015</time>

    <p>The other day I had been looking up information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a>. I’m new to some of the topics in this field but I have been introduced to some before. I’ve always wanted to learn more. The idea of teaching a computer how to “learn” just seems intriguing.</p>

<p>Specifically I had been researching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">neural networks</a>. They are useful because they can help uncover hidden patterns in a plethora of data, or be taught to perform certain tasks such as handwriting or facial recognition.</p>

<p>I had watched an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0pm3BrIUFo">MIT Open CourseWare Lecture</a> which gave a rough introduction to neural networks which I found to be quite captivating. I found it so fantastic actually that I wanted to share the basic concepts here. For the purpose of this post, I’m going to assume that we’re teaching this neural net via supervised learning.</p>

<p>Or, in other words, we are going to make this neural network learn by giving it a set of “correct” input and output values, which it will use to calibrate, or change its own structure to make sure that it also outputs the correct values. Now let’s dive in!</p>

<p>To explain briefly, neural networks are modeled after the same neurons that exist in our brain.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Neuron.svg/500px-Neuron.svg.png" alt="Image of Neuron" /></p>

<p>For our purpose we focus on only a few of the main features of a neuron which are critical to our model for a neural network.</p>

<p>The main parts of the neuron we want to focus on are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dendrites</li>
  <li>The Axon</li>
  <li>The Axon Terminals</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The dendrites</strong> are small tree-like structures that are stimulated when enough neurotransmitters are dumped into the synapse between a neuron and the end of the dendrite. Some of these dendrites might be easier to stimulate than other based on various factors</p>

<p><strong>The axon</strong> is the lengthy part of the neuron which simply propagates a “spike” of energy to the axon terminals, which originates from the dendrites.</p>

<p><strong>The axon terminals</strong> dump neurotransmitters into the synapse to help stimulate the dendrites of the next neuron.</p>

<p>If there are enough neurotransmitters dumped into the synapse, It will stimulate the next neuron’s dendrites, sending a spike of “excitement” or “energy” to the next neuron, and so forth. At each end of the axom terminals there is another neuron’s dendrites separated by a space called the <strong>synapse</strong>. If a neuron is stimulated, it will dump neurotransmitters into the synapse.</p>

<p>This is a gross simplification of a neuron, but for the model of a neural network and the backpropagation algorithm, we don’t need to understand more than this.</p>

<h4 id="modeling-the-neuron">Modeling the Neuron</h4>
<hr />

<p><img src="../assets/images/neural-nets/net-model.jpg" alt="Image of Model" /></p>

<p>First, notice the inputs. Each input from <script type="math/tex">x_1</script> to <script type="math/tex">x_n</script> is given as an input to the neuron. Each of the inputs is multiplied by a weight <script type="math/tex">w</script> corresponding to an input before being summed into the function.</p>

<p>The neuron also has a bias, labeled  <script type="math/tex">b</script> in the diagram, which I like to call <script type="math/tex">w_0</script>. We can think of this bias as a given input to each neuron that always has a value of -1. The weight of the bias input <script type="math/tex">w_0</script> can be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<p>Think of this part as the neurotransmitters being the inputs multiplied by the weights which stimulate the dendrites of the neuron.</p>

<p>From here we can represent the total stimulus as the sum of each input multiplied by a corresponding weight.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">-w_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_iw_i</script>

<p>The value of this will be then be passed onto the activation, or <em>threshold</em> function. The threshold function might be best viewed as a single-step function, where say once the input <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> reaches a certain value, it will output a certain value. We’re going to keep this to ones and zeros.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/neural-nets/threshold-med.png" alt="Threshold Example" /></p>

<p>Next, once the threshold is activated or not, we will get an output from this neuron. Once we run this neural network through for the first time, we are going to need to find out how good (or bad) the neural network did at predicting our answer.</p>

<p>Remember how I said that the neural network is given a set of “correct” inputs and outputs to learn from? Well here’s where that comes into play.</p>

<p>Let’s say that our output of the neural net is <script type="math/tex">y</script> and our desired or <em>correct</em> output is going to be assigned to <script type="math/tex">d</script>. We are going to need a function to test our performance of the neural network.</p>

<p>Let’s call this function <script type="math/tex">P</script>. Also, for simplicity’s sake, and because this is <em>mathematically convenient</em> we’re going to make the performance function the following:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(d, y) = -\frac{1}{2}(d-y)^2</script>

<p>(<em>You’ll see what I mean by mathematically convenient later</em>)</p>

<h4 id="adjusting-the-model">Adjusting the Model</h4>
<hr />

<p>So now we’ve got this model. We have a function to test whether our output is close to what we want it to be. We have a way to add our inputs together. What comes next?</p>

<p>Well, we need to have some way of adjusting the neuron to make sure we get closer to our desired output. But how do we know what to adjust? and by how much?</p>

<p>We’re going to use a method called <strong>gradient descent</strong> (or <em>ascent</em> depending on direction). We’re going to use some math here.</p>

<p>So we know that our desired outputs <script type="math/tex">d</script> can be given by <script type="math/tex">\overline{d} = g(\overline{x})</script>; where <script type="math/tex">\overline{d}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\overline{x}</script> are our vectors of inputs and desired outputs that our neural network is going to learn from.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t know what function <script type="math/tex">g</script> is, which is why we’re using the neural network to represent it. With the neural networks, we can represent our inputs and outputs by a multivaraite function <script type="math/tex">f</script>. This function can be represented by <script type="math/tex">\overline{y} = f(\overline{x}, \overline{w})</script>.</p>

<p>Given these functions, we can see our performance function is now</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(d, f(\overline{x}, \overline{w})) = -\frac{1}{2}(d-f(\overline{x}, \overline{w}))^2</script>

<hr />
<p>Random junk</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{i=0}^{N} = 1</script>
