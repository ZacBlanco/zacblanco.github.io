Since I'm pretty new to blogging I haven't found the platform yet that I like best. I decided blogger was a little too plain and wordpress had some better layouts but didn't give me enough control, so I've decided to move to jekyll hosting using github pages.<br /><br />I won't be posting here any longer. Please direct all traffic to <a href="http://zacblanco.github.io/">zacblanco.github.io</a>.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I just want to add my previous post about an updated site-- well. Now that I'm using Jekyll I won't be able to keep that as the landing page. You can still find it and view-source <a href="http://zacblanco.github.io/s-old/index.html">zacblanco.github.io/s-old/index.html</a>

So I just wanted to let you guys know that I've updated my GitHub pages site. Because I like learning and building things form scratch to learn how everything is put together I built my site from the ground up and learned a few things along the way.<br /><br />I was inspired to do this redesign after I came across flexbox. A CSS display property that I had not previously known of. It makes a lot of resizing and overall site layout much easier. I was inspired to rebuild my site using this.<br /><br />The great thing is that flexbox is easy. It just works. and It's trivial to center things in your screen and resize the browser causing them to flow onto other line. It really is a great tool. The one caveat is that it doesn't have great browser support.<br /><br />I've currently tested on the most updated versions of the major browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and so far Chrome and Firefox render the page properly. Unfortunately however, Safari definitely does not render the page properly. Most older browsers don't Although I'm not too worried about this. Even with improper display the page is still navigable. IE11 surprisingly does. Even with limited support for this display I think people should start adopting it in their designs so we can force more people to upgrade their browsers, so that everyone can anjoy a modern browsing experience.<br /><br />Over the next few days I'll do my best to post some simple tutorials using flexbox and some of the new CSS3 tricks I've learned over the weekend while I made my site.<br /><br />In the meantime you should check out&nbsp;<a href="http://flexboxin5.com/" target="_blank">flexboxin5</a>&nbsp;it helped me figure out what I was doing and what to include in my CSS to fix the layouts. It's a great tutorial<br /><br />Don't forget to check out the new design!<br /><br /><a href="http://zacblanco.github.io/">zacblanco.github.io</a><br /><br />Zac

Just thought it would be fun to share here. As of today I am confirmed to be working as an intern this summer with Hortonworks; a major corporate contributor to the open-source Hadoop platform.<br /><br />I still have a lot to learn as a ECE/Comp. Sci student, but I'm sure this internship will prepare me for the future. I know that I'll be surrounded by some of the best minds in the industry this summer and I really hope to learn as much as I can from my future colleagues.<br /><br />In light of this I thought it would be fun to make a new desktop background. I took a large image of the Hortonworks logo, the image editor GIMP and a little magic to pull this together:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S1nePG9AdvQ/VPf1tYvdE3I/AAAAAAAAEBg/hMMzj7M4Uts/s1600/Hortonworks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S1nePG9AdvQ/VPf1tYvdE3I/AAAAAAAAEBg/hMMzj7M4Uts/s1600/Hortonworks.png" height="200" width="320" /></a></div><br />Feel free to copy and redistribute this too!<br /><br />Cheers to a (hopefully) fantastic opportunity.
