Being the first post here I feel compelled to at least introduce myself to anyone who decides to read my blog.<div><br /></div><div>My name is Zac Blanco. I'm currently an undergraduate studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University. I hope to also double major with computer science, and eventually continue on to graduate school. My expected graduation date is May of 2018</div><div><br /></div><div>I wanted to start a blog to share my thoughts and ideas about any of my work, projects, and other interests. Most topics here will converge on ideas in computer science theory, programming, and technology.</div><div><br /></div><div>Enjoy!<br /><div><br /></div></div>
