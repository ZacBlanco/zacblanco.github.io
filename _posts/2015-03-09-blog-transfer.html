<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
Since I'm pretty new to blogging I haven't found the platform yet that I like best. I decided blogger was a little too plain and wordpress had some better layouts but didn't give me enough control, so I've decided to move to jekyll hosting using github pages.<br /><br />I won't be posting here any longer. Please direct all traffic to <a href="http://zacblanco.github.io/">zacblanco.github.io</a>.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I just want to add my previous post about an updated site-- well. Now that I'm using Jekyll I won't be able to keep that as the landing page. You can still find it and view-source <a href="http://zacblanco.github.io/s-old/index.html">zacblanco.github.io/s-old/index.html</a>
