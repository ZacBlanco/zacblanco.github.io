So here we are again - another semester of introductory physics at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. This is the Fall 2015 semester. This will be a kind-of continuation from the Physics IB guide from the previous spring 2015 semester.

The aim of this is post/page to provide a (somewhat) comprehensive guide to this class by periodically updating it throughout the semester. My plan is to make notes during lecture as well as provide practice problems and explanations.

Without furthur ado - Let's dive in!

## September 3rd, 2015

Almost everything in the universe can be described by just 4 (!) equations.

### Electric Charge

- _Electric Charge_ is a physical quantity that characterizes how charged object participate in electrostatic interactions

#### Electric Charge Properties
 
- It is a scalar value
- It is quantizes - meaning that a charge must be in integer multiples of the fundamental value of charge
 - This fundamental amount is the charge of an electron.
 - $$ e = 1.6 * 10 ^ -19 C $$
 - The net charge of any isolated system is _conserved_. i.e the net charge of the universe is zero
 
 
### Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's law describes the _forces_ that charged particles exert on each other due to...well...simply their charge.

The equation for Coulomb's law is the following:

> $$ F_{12} = k\frac{\left|q_1q_2\right|}{r^2} $$

Now let's quickly describe each quantity

 - $$ F_{12} $$ is the force that each particle exerts on one another. This means that _both particles experience the same force_!
 - $$ k $$ is a constant value expressed in this function. It's value is equal to $$ \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} $$
 - $$ q_1 $$ and $$ q_2 $$ are the charges of each particle measured in  _Coulomb's_ or the symbol $$ C $$
 - $$ r $$ is the distance between the two charges.
 
 
> $$ k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 9*10^9 \frac{Nm^2}{C^2} $$

> $$ \epsilon_0 = 9 * 10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{Nm^2} $$
 
### The Superposition Principle

 - This principle states that the _interaction between any two charges is unaffected by any other charges present_
 - This principle also tells us that the equations are _linear_. The solutions of multiple equations can be added together to form other solutions (as in the presence of multiple charges). 
 
 
### Electric Dipole

An _electric dipole_ is formed by two charges $$ +q $$ and  $$ -q $$ at the distance $$ d $$ apart.
 

And that wraps up section one! I hope to keep this as up to date as possible.
