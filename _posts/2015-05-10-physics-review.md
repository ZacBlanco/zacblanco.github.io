## Temperature and Heat

##### Temperature in Fahrenheit

> $$ T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32 $$

This equation is used to convert Temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. $$ T_F $$ is the temperature in Fahrenheit and $$ T_C $$ is the temperature in Celsius.

##### Temperature in Celsius

> $$ T_C = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32) $$

This equation is used to convert Temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius and is simply a re-arraned form of the above equation.

##### Temperature in Kelvin

> $$ T_K = T_C = 273 $$

Temperature on the absolute scale is measured in Kelvins. $$ 0K $$ is absolute 0. Other temperature scales can be conerted to Kelvin by the above formula.

##### The Ideal Gas Law

> $$ PV = nRT $$

This is the ideal gas law. In physics we like to use SI units, therefore these quantities are measured in their respective SI units. P is pressure in pascals. V is volume in $$ m^3 $$. n is number of moles of gas. R is equal to $$ 8.314 \frac{J}{mole\cdot K} $$. T is temperature measured in Kelvin.

##### Gas Constant, R

> $$ R = 8.314 \frac{J}{mole\cdot K} $$

Just  restatement of value of the gas constant, R.

> $$ R = \frac{PV}{nT} $$

We can rearrange the ideal gas law into this form. We can set two states of a gas equal to each other because we know the gas constant is equal, then we can solve for any changes in values.

> $$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{P_1} $$

A thermometer measures temperature by using the change in pressure that occurs when the temperature rises (or falls) in order to make measurements.

##### Linear Thermal Expansion

> $$ \Delta L = \alpha L_0\Delta T $$

A solid rod will change length with a change in temperature. $$ \alpha $$ is a constant different for specific materials that is traditionally measured in $$ (^\circ C)^{-1} $$ or $$K^{-1} $$. $$ L_0 $$ is the inital length of the beam at the initial temperature. $$ \Delta T $$ is the change in temperature measured in Celsius or Kelvin

##### Thermal Stress

> $$ \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \alpha\Delta T $$

Thermal stress can be simply found by divinding $$ L_0 $$ by the above equation to obtain the thermal stress by a change in temperature.

##### calories and Joules

> $$ 1 cal = 4.186 \cdot J$$

1 calorie is the amount of energy is takes to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by one degree celsius. This energy is equal to 4.186 Joules.

##### Heat Transfer

> $$ Q = mc\Delta T $$

We can find the amount of heat required to change the themperature of the object if we know the specific heat, $$ c $$, and the mass of the object. $$ c $$ is specific to every material. $$ \Delta T $$ is the change in temperature, usually in Kelvin or celsius depending on the units of the specific heat capacity.

##### Total Mass

> $$ m = nM $$

The total mass of a gas, or material, can be found by multiplying the number of moles, $$ n $$, and the Molar Mass, $$ M $$. It is usually measured in $$ \frac{g}{mole} $$.

> $$ Q = nMc\Delta T = nC\Delta T $$

Substituting the above equation into the one for heat transfer we find that there is a Molar heat capacity $$ C $$ which is equal to $$ Mc $$. 

##### Thermal Expansion in 3 Dimensions

> $$ B = 3\alpha $$

To find a coefficient for volumetric expansion, we can simply multiply a material's linear expansion constant by 3 to find the value for volumetric expansion.

##### Volumetric Expansion

> $$ \Delta V = BV_0\Delta T $$

The change in volume of an object due to a change in temperature. $$ B $$ is a constant that we defined above. $$ V_0 $$ is the inital volume of the object. $$ \Delta T $$ is simply the change in temperature, typically in Celsius or Kelvin.

##### Heat Required for Phase Change

> $$ Q = \pm mL $$

We can calculate the heat required for a phase change of a compound by simply multiplying the mass of the compound by the latent heat of fusion, or latent heat of fusion. Latent heat, $$ L $$ is typically measured in $$ \frac{J}{kg} $$.

##### Thermal Conductivity

> $$ H = \frac{dQ}{dt} = kA\frac{T_H - T_C}{L} $$

The rate of heat transfer between a hot and cold resevoir is equal to the change in heat, or energy, over a period of time. This means the value is measured in Watts. We can calculate the power flowing through an object by using its thermal conductivity, $$ k $$, the cross-sectional area that the heat is flowing through, $$ A $$. The Temperatures of each hot and cold resevoir respectively measured in $$ K $$. and the length of the heat conductor, $$ L $$.

##### Heat Radiation

> $$ H = Ae\sigma T^4 $$

Every body emits some kind of electromagnetic radiation. The amount of power that a body emits is equal to its surface area, $$ A $$ multipled by its emmisivity, $$ e $$, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $$ \sigma $$, and the temperature of the body in Kelvin. However, note that this equation is valid if the body and its surrounding environment are of the same temperature.

> $$ \sigma = 5.6704 \cdot 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2\cdot K^4} $$

This is the constant value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $$ \sigma $$.

> $$ H = Ae\sigma(T^4 - T_S^4) $$

If a body and it's surrounding temperature are not the same, then we can find the power emitted by a body by the above equation where $$ T_S $$ is the temperature of the surroundings.

## Thermal Properties of Matter

##### The Ideal Gas Law (Again)

> $$ PV = nRT $$

Just iterating over the gas law again. Make sure you know it!

##### Relation Between PV and the Translational Kinetic Energy of a Gas

> $$ PV = \frac{3}{2}K_{TR} $$

$$ K_{TR} $$ is the Average translational kinetic energy of a gas. $$ PV $$ is equal to $$ \frac{3}{2} $$ this value. 

##### Average Translational Kinetic Energy

> $$ K_{TR} = \frac{3}{2}nRT $$

The average translational kinetic energy of an entire gas is equal to this. $$ nRT $$ are their respective values from the ideal gas law.

##### Molar Mass

> $$ M = N_Am $$

The mass of one molecule of a gas can be found by dividing the Molar Mass, $$ M $$ by Avogadro's number, $$ N_A $$. It is equal to $$ 6.022 \cdot 10^{23} $$.

###### Average Kinetic Energy of a Gas

> $$ \frac{1}{2}M(v^2)_{ave} = \frac{3}{2}RT $$

We can relat the average kinetic energy of molecule of a gas by the values of R and T and its Molar Mass

##### Average Kinetic Energy of a Molecule (Molar Mass)

> $$ k = \frac{R}{N_A} = 1.381\cdot 10^{-23} $$

The Boltzmann constant, $$ k $$, is simply equal to the gas constant, $$ R $$ divided by Avogadro's Number.

##### Average Kinetic Energy of a Molecule (Mass)

> $$ \frac{1}{2}m(v^2)_{ave} = \frac{3}{2}kT $$

If we know the mass of the gas, then the average kinetic energy of a molecule is simply the above equation.

##### Root-Mean Square Speed of a Molecule

> $$ v_{rms} = \sqrt{v_{rms}^2} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} $$

We can calculate the average velocity of a gas particle by the above equations. Remember $$ m $$ is just the normal mass of the gas, while $$ M $$ is the Molar mass.

#### Heat Capacities

Using the theory behind the kinetic energy of a particle, we can estimate the heat capacities of simple gases that have _constant volume_. It is important that we note this is with constant volume.

##### Monatomic Gas

> $$ C_V = \frac{3}{2}R $$

For a monatomic gas, this is simply the heat capacity

##### Diatomic Gas

> $$ C_V = \frac{5}{2}R $$

For a diatomic gas (two atoms per molecule) the heat capacity is $$ \frac{5}{2} R $$ which is because we add rotational degrees of freedom to the molecule.

##### Monatomic Solid

> $$ C_V = 3R $$

For a solid that has molecules of only 1 atom, the heat capacity at constant volume is only $$ 3R $$.

> $$ E_T = 3nRT $$

The total Energy of a solid is equal to $$ 3nRT $$.


## The First Law of Thermodynamics

> $$ W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}pdV $$

The amount of work done by a gas at pressure, p, is equal to the integral from one volume to another of $$ p $$.  This is the general equation.

> $$ W = p(V_2 - V_1) $$

At constant pressure, the work done is simply the pressure (in pascals), multipled by the difference of the two states of volume.

> $$ W = nRT\cdot ln(\frac{V_2}{V_1}) = nRT\cdot ln(\frac{p_1}{P_2}) $$

To derive this, from the ideal gas law, $$ P = \frac{NRT}{V} $$. If we replace P with this value in our integral, we find that $$ W = nRT \int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{dV}{V} $$. This is how we find the equation. All units are in SI. Also, because $$\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{p_1}{p_2} $$, we get the second form of this equation.

#### _The First Law of Thermodynamics_

> $$ U_2 - U_1 = \Delta U = Q - W $$

This is considered _The First Law of Thermodynamics_. It is essential to understand this. Basically this equation related the amount of heat added to (or lost) by a gas, and the amount of work done on/by the gas. We can find the change in internal energy between any two states by this equation. $$ \Delta U $$ is the change in internal energy between two states. $$ Q $$ is the amount of heat added or lost by a gas. $$ W $$ is the amount of work. It is important to note the sign convention. Adding heat to a gas denotes $$ +Q $$. Taking heat away is $$ -Q $$. Work done _by the gas_ denotes $$ +W $$. If the work is done _on the gas_, then we have $$ -W $$.

> $$ \Delta U = Q - p\Delta V $$

If gas is at a constant pressure and volume is changing, we know that the $$ W = p\Delta V $$ so that gives us this equation.

> $$ \Delta U = nC_V\Delta T $$

For a gas at constant volume and a changing temperature (isobaric), we can relate a small change in the internal energy $$ \Delta U $$ to the Molar heat capacity at constant volume

###### Adiabatic Process

> $$ \Delta U = -W $$

In n adiabatic process, heat is not lost or gained, therefore the change in internal energy is simply the work done by the system.

##### Isochoric Process

> $$ \Delta U = Q $$

An isochoric process means that there is no change in volume. If there is no change in volume, then the system can't be doing any work, which means $$ W = 0 $$. Therefore our change in internal energy must only be the heat added to the system.

##### Isobaric Process

> $$ W = p\Delta V $$

In an isobaric process, the pressure is constant, which means we can relate the amount of work done by a gas to be $$ p\Delta V $$.

##### Isothermal Process

> $$ \Delta U = 0 \therefore Q = W $$

In an isothermal process there is no change in the temperature of the system. Therefore is there isn't a change in the temperature, then the change in internal energy $$ \Delta U = 0 $$.

##### Heat capcity at a constant pressure

> $$ C_p = C_V + R $$

We find the molar heat capacity for a gas at constant pressure (not volume) is simply equal to its molar heat capacity at constant volume plus the gas constant, $$ R $$.

##### Ratio of Heat Capacities

> $$ \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_V} $$

$$ \gamma $$ is the ratio of heat capacities which is simply the molar heat capacity at constant pressure over the molar heat capacity at constant volume.

#### Work Done in Adiabatic Processes

> $$ W = nC_V(T_1 - T_2) $$

In an adiabatic process we can find the work done by a gas to be equal to the number of moles of the gas, multipled by the molar heat capacity at constant volume multiplied byh the change in temperature from two states, $$ \Delta T $$. Note that temperature should be in Kelvin.


> $$ W = \frac{C_V}{R}(p_1V_1 - p_2V_2) $$

Again in an adiabatic process we rearrange what we have above we can find that the work done over two states is equal to the $$ C_V $$ multiplied by the pressures and volumes at each state of the gas.

## The Second Law Of Thermodynamics

##### Net Heat Absorbed in an Engine Cycle

> $$ Q = |Q_H| - |Q_C| $$

##### Thermal Efficiency of an Engine

> $$ e = \frac{W}{Q_H} = 1 + \frac{Q_C}{Q_H} = 1 - \left|\frac{Q_C}{Q_H}\right| $$

##### Thermal Efficiency in an Otto Cycle

> $$ e = 1- \frac{1}{r^{\gamma - 1}} $$

##### Work an Heat in Refrigeration

> $$ |Q_H| = Q_C + W $$

##### Efficiency of Refrigeration

> $$ K = \left|\frac{Q_C}{W}\right| = \left|\frac{Q_C}{Q_H - Q_C}\right| $$

##### Efficiency of Refrigeration (Form 2)

> $$ K = \frac{H}{P} $$

##### Efficicency of a Carnot Engine

> $$ e_{Carnot} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} = \frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H} $$

##### Efficiency Through Refrigeration

> $$ K_{Carnot} = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C} $$

##### Entropy

> $$ \Delta S = \frac{Q}{T} $$

##### Entropy Restated

> $$ \Delta S = \int_1^2\frac{dQ}{T} $$
