**Spring 2017 Data Structures (CS112) Study Group**

For the students in my 112 study group you can [find our group page here](/education/data-structures/study-group/)

Occasionally I'll create study guides or take notes on my computer. I like to post these online so others can use them too!

I highly encourage contributions to this part of the site! Everything is written and [markdown](http://blanco.io/blog/markup-languages/markdown-is-awesome/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is used for math formatting.


At each link you should be able to find useful resources for each class and at least one set of notes.
