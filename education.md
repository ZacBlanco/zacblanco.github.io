Occasionally I'll create study guides or take notes on my computer. I like to post these online so others can use them too!

I highly encourage contributions to this part of the site! Everything is written and [markdown](http://blanco.io/blog/markup-languages/markdown-is-awesome/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is used for math formatting.

To start contributing, you'll need to [make a fork of](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) [this site](https://github.com/ZacBlanco/zacblanco.github.io) using GitHub and then once you've made changes, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
