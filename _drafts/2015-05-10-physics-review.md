The format of this post will be the following: For each equation I will explain each variables used in the equation, the typical units used, any constant values (if they haven't been defined already). If there are concepts that don't reside within equations, they will be explained nearest to the equations I feel are most related to that concept.

> $$ F_B = \rho V $$


## Temperature and Heat

##### Temperature in Fahrenheit

> $$ T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32 $$

This equation is used to convert Temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit. $$ T_F $$ is the temperature in Fahrenheit and $$ T_C $$ is the temperature in Celsius.

##### Temperature in Celsius

> $$ T_C = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32) $$

This equation is used to convert Temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius and is simply a re-arraned form of the above equation.

##### Temperature in Kelvin

> $$ T_K = T_C = 273 $$

Temperature on the absolute scale is measured in Kelvins. $$ 0K $$ is absolute 0. Other temperature scales can be conerted to Kelvin by the above formula.

##### The Ideal Gas Law

> $$ PV = nRT $$

This is the ideal gas law. In physics we like to use SI units, therefore these quantities are measured in their respective SI units. P is pressure in pascals. V is volume in $$ m^3 $$. n is number of moles of gas. R is equal to $$ 8.314 \frac{J}{mole\cdot K} $$. T is temperature measured in Kelvin.

##### Gas Constant, R

> $$ R = 8.314 \frac{J}{mole\cdot K} $$

Just  restatement of value of the gas constant, R.

> $$ R = \frac{PV}{nT} $$

We can rearrange the ideal gas law into this form. We can set two states of a gas equal to each other because we know the gas constant is equal, then we can solve for any changes in values.

> $$ \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{P_1} $$

A thermometer measures temperature by using the change in pressure that occurs when the temperature rises (or falls) in order to make measurements.

##### Linear Thermal Expansion

> $$ \Delta L = \alpha L_0\Delta T $$

A solid rod will change length with a change in temperature. $$ \alpha $$ is a constant different for specific materials that is traditionally measured in $$ (^\circ C)^{-1} $$ or $$K^{-1} $$. $$ L_0 $$ is the inital length of the beam at the initial temperature. $$ \Delta T $$ is the change in temperature measured in Celsius or Kelvin

##### Thermal Stress

> $$ \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \alpha\Delta T $$

Thermal stress can be simply found by divinding $$ L_0 $$ by the above equation to obtain the thermal stress by a change in temperature.

##### calories and Joules

> $$ 1 cal = 4.186 \cdot J$$

1 calorie is the amount of energy is takes to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by one degree celsius. This energy is equal to 4.186 Joules.

##### Heat Transfer

> $$ Q = mc\Delta T $$

We can find the amount of heat required to change the themperature of the object if we know the specific heat, $$ c $$, and the mass of the object. $$ c $$ is specific to every material. $$ \Delta T $$ is the change in temperature, usually in Kelvin or celsius depending on the units of the specific heat capacity.

##### Total Mass

> $$ m = nM $$

The total mass of a gas, or material, can be found by multiplying the number of moles, $$ n $$, and the Molar Mass, $$ M $$. It is usually measured in $$ \frac{g}{mole} $$.

> $$ Q = nMc\Delta T = nC\Delta T $$

Substituting the above equation into the one for heat transfer we find that there is a Molar heat capacity $$ C $$ which is equal to $$ Mc $$. 

##### Thermal Expansion in 3 Dimensions

> $$ B = 3\alpha $$

To find a coefficient for volumetric expansion, we can simply multiply a material's linear expansion constant by 3 to find the value for volumetric expansion.

##### Volumetric Expansion

> $$ \Delta V = BV_0\Delta T $$

The change in volume of an object due to a change in temperature. $$ B $$ is a constant that we defined above. $$ V_0 $$ is the inital volume of the object. $$ \Delta T $$ is simply the change in temperature, typically in Celsius or Kelvin.

##### Heat Required for Phase Change

> $$ Q = \pm mL $$

We can calculate the heat required for a phase change of a compound by simply multiplying the mass of the compound by the latent heat of fusion, or latent heat of fusion. Latent heat, $$ L $$ is typically measured in $$ \frac{J}{kg} $$.

##### Thermal Conductivity

> $$ H = \frac{dQ}{dt} = kA\frac{T_H - T_C}{L} $$

The rate of heat transfer between a hot and cold resevoir is equal to the change in heat, or energy, over a period of time. This means the value is measured in Watts. We can calculate the power flowing through an object by using its thermal conductivity, $$ k $$, the cross-sectional area that the heat is flowing through, $$ A $$. The Temperatures of each hot and cold resevoir respectively measured in $$ K $$. and the length of the heat conductor, $$ L $$.

##### Heat Radiation

> $$ H = Ae\sigma T^4 $$

Every body emits some kind of electromagnetic radiation. The amount of power that a body emits is equal to its surface area, $$ A $$ multipled by its emmisivity, $$ e $$, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $$ \sigma $$, and the temperature of the body in Kelvin.

> $$ \sigma = 5.6704 \cdot 10^{-8} \frac{W}{m^2\cdot K^4} $$

This is the constant value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $$ \sigma $$.

> $$ H = Ae\sigma(T^4 - T_S^4) $$

## Thermal Properties of Matter

> $$ PV = nRT $$

> $$ PV = \frac{3}{2}K_{TR} $$

> $$ K_{TR} = \frac{3}{2}nRT $$

> $$ M = N_Am $$

> $$ \frac{1}{2}m(v^2)_ave = \frac{3}{2}RT $$

> $$ k = \frac{R}{N_A} = 1.381\cdot 10^{-23} $$

> $$ \frac{1}{2}m(v^2)_ave = \frac{3}{2}kT $$

> $$ v_{rms} = \sqrt{v_rms^2} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} $$

##### Monatomic Gas

> $$ C_V = \frac{3}{2}R $$

##### Diatomic Gas

> $$ C_V = \frac{5}{2}R $$

##### Monatomic Solid

> $$ C_V = 3R $$

> $$ E_T = 3nRT $$


## The First Law of Thermodynamics

> $$ W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}pdV $$

> $$ W = p(V_2 - V_1) $$

> $$ W = nRT\cdot ln(\frac{V_2}{V_1}) = nRT\cdot ln(\frac{p_1}{P_2}) $$

> $$ U_2 - U_1 = \Delta U = Q - W $$

> $$ \Delta U = Q - p\Delta V $$

> $$ \Delta U = nC_V\Delta T $$

###### Adiabatic

> $$ \Delta U = -W $$

##### Isochoric

> $$ \Delta U = Q $$

##### Isobaric

> $$ W = p\Delta V $$

##### Isothermal

> $$ \Delta U = 0 \therefore Q = W $$

> $$ C_p = C_V + R $$

> $$ \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_V} $$

> $$ W = nC_V(T_1 - T_2) $$

> $$ W = \frac{C_V}{R}(p_1V_1 - p_2V_2) $$

## The Second Law Of Thermodynamics


> $$ Q = |Q_H| - |Q_C| $$

> $$ e = \frac{W}{Q_H} = 1 + \frac{Q_C}{Q_H} = 1 - \left|\frac{Q_C}{Q_H}\right| $$

> $$ e = 1- \frac{1}{r^{\gamma - 1}} $$

> $$ |Q_H| = Q_C + W $$

> $$ K = \left|\frac{Q_C}{W}\right| = \left|\frac{Q_C}{Q_H - Q_C}\right| $$

> $$ K = \frac{H}{P} $$

> $$ e_{Carnot} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} = \frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H} $$

> $$ K_{Carnot} = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C} $$

> $$ dS = \frac{dQ}{T} = \Delta S = \frac{Q}{T} $$

> $$ \Delta S = \int_1^2\frac{dQ}{T} $$
