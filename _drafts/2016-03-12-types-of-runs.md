As an avid runner I am continually looking for ways to improve my performance. Most recently I have read the book _Daniel's Running Formula_ in hopes to gain a better understanding through a book which approaches training in a scientific manner.

In the book Daniel's outlines five different types of training runs. They are:

1. **E** or Easy runs
2. **M** or Marathon pace runs
3. **T** or Threshold Runs 
4. **I** or Interval training
5. **R** or Repetition training


## Easy Runs (**E**)

According to Daniel's book easy training runs will stress the body to be using anywhere from 59%-74% $$VO_2\text{max}$$. Or, in terms of heart rate, anywehere between 65%-78% maximum heart rate.

Other notes and suggestions

- **E** runs should always be at a minimum 30 minutes
- The runner should be constantly tring to maintain good running form and economy throughout the entirety of an **E** run
- **L** style runs are runs which are at **E** pace but tend to be longer than the typical **E** training day.

## Marathon Pace Runs (**M**)

This type of run is very specific to people training for marathons and half-marathons.

One way to estimate **M** pace is to take your best 10K time and then add 3 minutes per 10K to that pace to obtain the **M** training pace.


For a quick conversion that is about 29 seconds per mile slower than 10K race pace.

**M** runs should always be less than 110 minutes, or 18 miles. Whichever comes first.


## Threshold Runs (**T**)

The intensity of a threshold run should be "comfortably hard". This means the pace is difficult, but not so difficult that it would be unable to be maintained.

Generally, "peaked and rested" you should be able to run at your **T** pace for approximately 60 minutes.

The point of **T** runs are to allow the body to adapt to higher blood lactate levels and get better at clearning the lactate from the bloodstream.

These runs are typically between 86-88 percent of $$VO_2\text{max}$$ (or 88-90% of maximum heart rate).
